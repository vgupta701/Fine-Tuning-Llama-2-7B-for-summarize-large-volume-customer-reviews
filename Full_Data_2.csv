1618 Asian Fusion,Christian was fabulous. We would highly recommend! Made our honeymoon experience. Everything on the menu is elevated but reasonably priced. The ambiance is everything. Can't wait to come back,Food - Elevated||Price - Reasonable||Ambiance - Great||Service - Fabulous 
1618 Asian Fusion,"As soon as we walked in it was very very warm but I figured because we were super close to the door when we walked in that's why... just wait.

We got the soup dumplings which were 4/5 because they were super super delicate but very flavorful.

Also got the duck skewers which were my favorite part of the night. 5/5

At this point I started sweating a little bit but figured I would cool down...

Entrees came and I got the lamb chops which were served in a bowl which made it hard to eat and the chops were on the chewy side so it was a 3/5.

My boyfriend got the sesame chicken which was very tasty 5/5.

By the time we started eating I wanted to leave so bad because no A/C was running. My boyfriend & I were excited to get dessert but by this time we wanted to leave because we felt sweaty & gross... also, the warm water didn't help at all...

This place was good but needs some improvement on the small things. I'm being picky because I've worked in restaurants & I have a degree in hospitality administration so there was lots of little things that could've made my experience better.","Food - Soup Dumplings (Delicate and Flavorful), Duck Skewers (Favorite), Lamb Chops (Hard to eat in a bowl and Chewy), Sesame Chicken (Tasty)||Ambiance - Very Warm||Service - Good||Experience - Good "
1618 Asian Fusion,Visited from Hawaii and was looking for a place with good food and music. 1618 did NOT disappoint. Food and service was amazing! As well as the live performance. Jackie was our server for the night and did such an amazing job! She was very attentive with such a positive attitude. The GM Jonel was very kind and always made sure we were enjoying our evening. I would definitely recommend this place to others!,"Food - Egg rolls (nice fry), Shrimp Panang Curry (started great but got sweeter, needed some acid to balance sweetness), Vegetable curry (started great but got sweeter, needed some acid to balance sweetness)||Music - Live performance||Service - Amazing "
1618 Asian Fusion,"1618 Asian fusion had great service! Shout out to Graham, Anj, Kiara and Bryan were so attentive. Super sweet, fast, and provided the best service at the bar top!

The Bao buns were delicious and General TSO chicken was fresh and full of flavor

The ambiance was super casual but lovely relaxing atmosphere, amidst the heavy traffic.","Food - Bao buns (delicious), General Tso chicken (fresh and flavorful)||Service - Best service at the bar top, super sweet and fast||Ambiance - Casual but lovely relaxing atmosphere "
1618 Asian Fusion,"Huge menu.  Egg rolls for appetizer and Shrimp Panang Curry for main dish.

The egg rolls had a nice fry.  The combination of shrimp and pork worked well.

The shrimp curry started out great.  It was creamy with the right amount of spice.  It was a big dish and it got sweeter the more we ate.  The curry needed some acid or salt to balance the sweetness.  Exact same feedback for the vegetable curry.

In all a very good meal.","Food - Egg rolls (nice fry), Shrimp Panang Curry (started great but got sweeter, needed some acid to balance sweetness), Vegetable curry (started great but got sweeter, needed some acid to balance sweetness)||Menu - Huge "
1618 Asian Fusion,"Came with friends for dinner on a Friday night. We had reservations for a table of 4. We were seated right away.

Our server greeted us promptly and had our drinks placed immediately. I tried the dragon fruit refresher and it was absolutely delicious!!

We split the appetizer for the table. I enjoyed the pork bun and the satays. The fresh spring roll, I would recommend, eating first because the wrap ends up sticking to the banana leaves and tears the longer you let them sit. I wish it was served with a peanut butter sauce, but it wasn't a deal breaker.

I ordered the green curry with filet mignon. Comes with steamed rice. The dish is so rich, but all I could taste was the smokiness of the steak. It overpowered the sweet curry. I liked that it had plenty of veggies and the steak was cut in bite sized pieces. It is on the spicier side, fair warning. You also can't adjust the spice level.

I tried my friend's crispy pad Thai, which was absolutely delicious. The sauce is rich and you can really get the lime flavor. It is pretty spicy though. I don't know if I'd be able to eat the whole dish, but it's yummy.

To get the spice out of my mouth, I ordered the Ube pana cotta. Oh my goodness!! This is such a stellar dessert!!! Ube was perfect. Not too sweet and the panna cotta was divine!!! I would go again just for this dessert.","Food - Dragon fruit refresher (absolutely delicious), Pork bun (enjoyed), Satays (enjoyed), Fresh spring roll (recommended but sticks to banana leaves if not eaten first), Green curry with filet mignon (rich with overpowering smokiness of the steak, on the spicier side), Crispy pad Thai (absolutely delicious but pretty spicy), Ube panna cotta (stellar dessert, perfect ube flavor, divine)||Service - Friendly and attentive "
1618 Asian Fusion,"I've been here so many times I feel like I've tried everything on the menu at this point.
For the new things: we tried the beef skewers and although they were tasty they had a very strong, specific flavor to them with the fish sauce and Thai basil wrapping (I think?). Not necessarily something I'd order again. Along with that, we got the crispy pad Thai which id never had before - the crispy noodles were not my thing but the flavor of this dish was fantastic honestly. Trying to figure out how we get these flavors on their regular pad Thai!
Our go tos:
1. Soup Dumplings
2. Duck skewers
3. Salt & pepper calamari
4. Coconut fried rice
5. Pineapple fried rice
6. Shrimp panang curry
7. Filet mignon with onion

Make a ressie - you'll need it...but either way, go here. Fantastic food. Always great service.

1618 Asian Fusion,"DEEE-LI-CIOUS!
Once you get past the slightly odd location in an apartment complex, the actual ambiance of the place is great. There's parking garages to park in for free so no issues there.
We started with the salt and pepper calamari along with the duck skewers. I'm not a huge fan of duck but with so many reviews on this dish, I had to give it a try and it was honestly delicious. Wasn't ""duck"" tasting at all! The calamari was also good and exactly what you would expect but I would have preferred a bigger portion for the price.
We then ordered the chicken pad Thai, seafood fried rice served in a coconut and the red curry with chicken. All 3 entrees were absolutely delicious with the perfect amount of heat for me without asking for any adjustments.
I would order the exact same meal again if I had to but ofcourse next time I'll want to try some of their other dishes as I'm sure they'll be as good!
Lastly, service was excellent. Our server was informative and very welcoming - cherry on top!","Food - Calamari (good but small portion), Duck skewers (delicious), Chicken pad Thai (absolutely delicious with perfect heat), Seafood fried rice served in a coconut (absolutely delicious with perfect heat), Red curry with chicken (absolutely delicious with perfect heat)||Location - odd||Parking - Free||Ambiance - Great||Service - Informative and welcoming||Price - high "

1618 Asian Fusion,"The wait was really long, so we put our name down and left, but about 30 minutes later we were able to be seated at the bar.

They had some really cool looking drinks what fruit around the display case, if you want something alcoholic to try. There was so much on the menu I wanted to get, but we agreed on the pho with short ribs and filet and the stir fried filet dish.

I like how they pour the broth at your table. The meats for both dishes were flavorful and tender. The soup broth was delicious as well. It was fun interacting with the bartender too. She was so friendly and sweet.",Food - Pho with short ribs and filet||Stir fried filet dish||Drinks - Cool looking||Service - Friendly and sweet 
1618 Asian Fusion,"1618 is a nice restaurant for an occasion, but overrated in my books. Definitely make a reservation before you go.

The food is tasty and the service is really solid, but the price for the portion is not so good. I was excited about the shrimp but you only get 5 pieces. Perhaps the best thing to get is the crispy pad thai, because it's something novel where the noodles are fried. Other things I tried could be found elsewhere in larger quantities at a less fancy place. Nonetheless, it's quality stuff and their cheesecake makes you feel classy.

There's free parking in the garage in the back.

I'll be back for another birthday dinner!","Food - Crispy pad thai (novel concept with fried noodles, tasty), Shrimp (tasty but small portion)||Service - Solid||Price - high "
1618 Asian Fusion,"I love the Peking duck here! Probably my fav Peking duck in Austin. It'd be great if there was an option to sub buns for crepes though :) the coconut fried rice was okay, not my favorite. It had some Tom-yum flavor, which I usually like for soup but tasted a bit strange for rice. 10/10 for presentation of the fried rice though. Good service, very friendly servers. Nice ambiance. I would definitely come back!","Food - Peking duck (loved), Coconut fried rice (okay, Tom-yum flavor tasted strange for rice, perfect presentation)||Service - friendly||Ambiance - nice||Menu - no option to sub buns for crepes "
1618 Asian Fusion,"My goodness. I'm a fan. The ambiance is upbeat and a bit loud at times, but it's wonderful for a dinner date. The xiao long bao is a MUST! The five sampler is a good portion to split with someone and it's nice to try a bit of everything!

The Pad Thai is good, but the next time I come I have to explore some newer options here. I wish I saved some room for dessert because that also looked incredible at the neighboring tables.

Big fan and will go again! Be wary of a bit of a wait time during peak dinner hours!

1618 Asian Fusion,"Visited 1618 for dinner during my visit after seeing it on Yelp's Top 100 list! We made a reservation a few weeks out. It's beautiful inside, and our server was extremely friendly and helpful.

My one gripe is that they don't offer any modifications to the majority of their dishes - I totally understand from a chef perspective, but as someone with dietary restrictions (and a low spice tolerance!!) it made it difficult because we couldn't order a few of the things we initially wanted to and had to pivot.

We split the house fried rice. It was delicious, but we were really hoping to try the more exciting pineapple or coconut ones - neither of which could have the spiciness removed so we opted out. I liked that we could get a combo of chicken, shrimp, and beef. We both agreed that the beef was our favorite.

I got the duck skewers, which were AMAZING. I just wish they were bigger!!! The dipping sauce they came with was perfect too. So tender and flavorful.

My friend ordered steamed dumplings. They were rainbow colored, and I'm not sure how they make them colorful so it kind of freaked me out a bit since I try not to consume artificial coloring, etc. I did try one and felt it was too chewy for my liking - I probably would have preferred them fried.","Food - House fried rice (delicious), Duck skewers (AMAZING, small portion), Steamed dumplings (colorful, too chewy)||Service - Friendly, helpful||Ambiance - Beautiful "
1618 Asian Fusion,"I completely understand why this place was on the top 100 restaurants in the country list. It's awesome.

Ambiance: Tucked away on Riverside, large wooden doors lead to a beautifully lit dining room, intimate bar and stunning decor. Each table is decorated with greenery.

Service: The staff is pretty attentive, no complaints. They take time to explain the menu and give suggestions. I've only had subpar service once.

The goods: I've had everything from the curries to fried rice, summer rolls, salt and pepper prawns and pad Thai. Everything was delicious, though the curries tend to be on the sweeter side.

I can't wait to dine here again.","Food - Delicious||Ambiance - Beautifully lit, intimate||Service - Attentive, helpful "
1618 Asian Fusion,"We were very impressed! They were able to seat us without a reservation. Everything was delicious! I loved the long bao and egg bao! Orange chicken was great too.

1618 Asian Fusion,"It pains me to write this review but I have waited long enough to do so. We used to love coming here, definitely one of our favorites and recommended it to so many. The special memories we have made here will last forever. However, now when I pass the restaurant I get a little queasy, a little sad, and not mad... but definitely dissappointed.

The last time we visited here, we brought a guest with us and we had a fantastic meal. However, all three of us became very ill within the next 24 hours. 100% food poisoning. It hit me the worst, because I was pregnant on top of it and ended up in the emergency room all night. Thankfully our guest didn't have it hit her until her plane landed back in her home state. I felt awful for taking her somewhere that ended up making us all sick, although I know anything can happen anywhere and it isn't necessarily a reflection of the establishment. We have never had an issue there any other time.

The problem was their reaction to this when we called them to let them know that others might be I'll as well and we wanted to give them a run down of what we ate so they could figure out what it was. The original person we spoke with was more than apologetic and ready to help but whoever he gave the information to, was not. They quite literally tried to blame us and say it was probably food allergies. Yes, all three of us suddenly have a good allergy we never knew about and all of us have the same one with the same reaction and it only hit us after eating at your restaurant. We had to stay extremely persistent to get any kind of help in the situation.

I miss their great food and violin events, but haven't been able to get myself to go back after their reaction to such a disappointing experience.",Food - Food poisoning 
1618 Asian Fusion,"We have been passing by this time and time again and wanting to go, yet just never made the move! Well my husband finally took me for a nice dinner and my oh my were our mouths and bellies thankful for the experience! And ""experience"" is the only way to describe this! Our first visit, our server was amazing and so helpful with recommendations- she actually convinced me to order something completely different just by her passion for this specific dish. We started the with soup dumplings and actually had no idea how to eat them - but you can find anything on YouTube these days right? I'm being 1000% serious, I totally searched in on YouTube so we could properly eat these dumplings. When I say I could quite literally just order multiple orders of the dumplings and eat them as my appetizer, meal, and dessert.... I mean it. The calamari was  seasoned to perfection and so satisfying. I'm fairly certain I got a box for two pieces of calamari. That's just silly to you if you haven't had it before... but once you have it, you, too, will not let it go to waste. The dipping sauce was the perfect match. For dinner, I got the Filet Green Curry and WOW , this was just the right dish for me, not too spicy, enough to save for second meal the next day (which was gold) - and very flavorful! My husband was the winner here, he got the Pho Rib (served with a filet) and DAMMMMNNNNN GINA! The presentation, the taste, the impending doom we both felt as the dish came near its end- because that flavor deserves to be tasted forever.  This dish was the star for sure!

We went back again on Christmas Eve for an incredible evening with Omar Phoenix playing the violin and we sat and ate and drank and melted in the presence of this incredible artist for four hours. I could write about that night alone forever but then I might need a publisher and a pen name. Magical. This place is absolutely magical.

Pro tips: the old fashioned is $18 but it's prepared tableside in a smoker and it's a whole thing! We enjoyed them. The five sampler: totally worth it. Eat the soup dumplings and watch youtube to do it properly. Your server can be amazing or mediocre but the food will always satisfy. If Omar is playing, make reservations, bring your friends, and go! Someone at your table MUST order the Pho Rib. That is a non negotiable.","Food - Soup Dumplings (recommended), Calamari (seasoned to perfection, satisfying), Filet Green Curry (flavorful), Pho Rib (star of the meal)||Drinks - Old Fashioned (worth it)||Service - Amazing||Ambiance - Magical atmosphere||Music - Omar Phoenix playing the violin on Christmas Eve||Menu - Sampler||Price - high "
1618 Asian Fusion,"I get takeout here all the time!

The Tom Kha soup is one of my favorites and it's really good here! The only downside is that you have to order rice and it isn't included in the price of the soup.

The soup has a lot of mushrooms in it here so if you are not a fan of those, I would not recommend. Also I will add that sometimes the mushrooms look like the chicken / it was hard for me to distinguish so I wouldn't count on being able to pick them out!

I have never actually eaten at the Restaurant, but it looks nice! It's in a sort of apartment complex strip, I'm guessing they have retail parking since spots are pretty limited, but I would double check before coming next.","Food - Tom Kha soup (good but rice not included, lots of mushrooms, difficult to distinguish mushroom from chicken)||Location - in an apartment complex strip||Parking - limited parking spots "
1618 Asian Fusion,"The ambiance of the restaurant was amazing. Wall was lined with sansaverrias and good mood lighting. Large wine rack decor in the middle of the restaurant floor. Service was good and attentive keeping our waters topped off. Wait time to get a seat was a bit long, but plenty of space outside to wait.

Came here for my dad's belated birthday and he was able to get a dessert which was this decadent taro flan.  But first started off the meal with the spicy Saigon chicken wings. They had a real nice crispy skin and right amount of fire. Then had duck four season which was served with lychee and longan for that sweet and savory taste. No bao buns like your usual Peking duck dishes. But the duck was cooked nicely and still really moist. We got the salted pepper shrimp, pineapple fried rice, and oxtail pho since my dad really wanted to try the oxtail. He was thoroughly impressed even though he knows how to make his own pho at home. The meat falls off the bone and the broth tasted rich yet clean. Fried rice wasn't a big portion and served in a pineapple but still really good fried rice!

Overall enjoyed my experience and would be back if I lived in Austin!","Food - Spicy Saigon Chicken Wings (nice crispy skin, right amount of fire), Duck Four Season (cooked nicely, moist), Salted Pepper Shrimp (impressive), Pineapple Fried Rice (good, small portion), Oxtail Pho (impressive, rich yet clean broth)||Ambiance - Amazing, sansaverrias lining the walls, large wine rack decor||Service - Good, attentive "
1618 Asian Fusion,"Soup Dumplings were very good. The tofu summer roll was easily the best I've ever had. I don't do them often because they aren't usually so flavorful. Green curry was great. Had a healthy curry sweat as I wrapped up my dinner. Wine list vast, as the drink list and deserts. Next time I will get more into those parts of the menu and the live music nights sound right up my alley.

1618 Asian Fusion,"The food is soooo good! I'm kind of picky in terms of Asian fusion, but 1618 actually did the fusion pretty good. It kept the original taste of all the dishes that we ordered.

The live music is great, not too loud, which is perfect. I really enjoyed the music and the food. I have to say the boss has a pretty good taste.

1618 Asian Fusion,"Service was phenomenal- shout out to Emily!

Came here for lunch with a group (total of 4 people) and it was a majority of our first time here. Emily served us and made great recommendations, this review would be all about her if I kept talking about her.

In my very own opinion I'd say that the food was average, good but average, and the service/nature of the restaurant made it 4 stars.

I ordered Calamari and Orange Chicken. Calamari was great, orange chicken was good. The rice was SO bland. I mean I get it, it's just white rice, but I've had better. The chicken, for me, could have been a TAD more crispy but I'm just being picky. It's probably the best portion of chicken I've had whenever ordering orange chicken. It wasn't over powered by breading.

My friend ordered salmon and said it was a great portion size and very tasty he left very full and satisfied.

The only true negative I'll mention is there were a decent amount of flies. When we first arrived there weren't that many. I think as more people arrived towards the end of our meal flies just kept flying in. Not sure if this is something they can truly control. But it was bothersome.

Overall 1618 is worth a second visit and for a different meal. I'll definitely have the calamari again though.","Food - Calamari (great), Orange Chicken (good, bland rice), Salmon (great, large portion), Rice (bland)||Service - Phenomenal, great recommendations||Ambiance - Nice, cozy||Flies - Decent number, bothersome "

I got the Saigon lamb rack and omg the flavoring of the lambs alone was so good but the salad and the sauce to dip made it even better. My friend got the filet mignon pho and the broth was just ready to eat and didn't require anything additional.

1618 Asian Fusion,"Once again we returned to one of our absolute favorite restaurants tonight, and it was utterly fantastic as always.
Thankfully we had already reserved because it was hopping.
Cassie was our server this time, and she amazing and attentive. Once we heard that the Salt and Pepper Lobster was the special, we decided to indulge ourselves, and were happy that we did. We also ordered our favorite green papaya salad with shrimp along with the 1618 egg roll. Delicious as always.
They insist on serving the freshest seafood, and tonight they really shined.

1618 Asian Fusion,"Back once again to one of our absolute favorite restaurants in Austin. As always the staff were friendly and welcoming from the moment we entered. Soon after we were escorted to our table.

Abigail was our wonderful server, and took perfect care of us from start to finish. We started with the egg rolls which were delicious as always, and followed that with the green mango salad, crisp, fresh and tasty.

For our mains we had the lamb, salt & pepper prawns and crispy pad Thai. Both were succulent as ever. Several times members of management stopped by to make sure that everything was to our liking. Of course it was.","Food - Egg rolls (delicious), Green mango salad (crisp, fresh, tasty), Lamb (succulent), Salt & pepper prawns (succulent), Crispy pad Thai (succulent)||Service - Wonderful, friendly, welcoming, attentive "
1618 Asian Fusion,"This was our first visit since Covid-19, and not only is it still as stellar as before, we were lucky to even get a table this evening.

There was apparently 100 tables booked for tonight, but they're operating at 50% capacity. Nonetheless, they were still rocking with the same awesome service from an obviously dedicated staff.

1618 Asian Fusion,"Earlier today we had one of our most enjoyable lunches in a while.  Although we arrived without reservations, they were able to accommodate us promptly.

Having been here before, we ordered our favorites: the papaya salad with shrimp, the crispy pad Thai with chicken, and the filet mignon with green onions, along with a cocktail each.

The space is beautiful, and it's clear that the staff truly appreciate their customers.","Food - Papaya salad with shrimp (enjoyable), Crispy pad Thai with chicken (satisfying), Filet mignon with green onions (delicious)||Ambiance - Beautiful||Service - Staff appreciative "
1618 Asian Fusion,"Food: excellent. Everyone at our table was satisfied. I enjoyed each dish we ordered. For a place that serves dim sum, they should really give you sauces for dipping on the side but the don't. When I asked our waitress she ended up giving me siracha and the brown plum sauce. Lol. Make it make sense.

Service: our waitress was great! She was super attentive. Brought everything at once and did well with the suggestions.

1618 Asian Fusion,"I wasn't the biggest fan of how cramped the tables felt, especially with how hot it was outside and inside. And there were a lot of flies that kept flying around. But our server was amazing and the food was pretty decent!

I had the panang curry and it was the perfect balance of sweet and spicy, and had a good amount of shrimp in it. The rice didn't taste that fresh because it was kind of dry and clumpy, but you can't really tell when you mix it with the curry.

Sadly, we didn't try any of their famous pho because it was so hot out, but will definitely try that as well as some of their desserts next time I find myself in that area.","Food - Panang Curry (perfect balance of sweet and spicy), Shrimp Panang Curry (good), rice (not fresh)||Service - Amazing||Ambiance - Cramped tables, hot environment, flies "
1618 Asian Fusion,"This restaurant was such a good experience. From planning it with the event planner via email to being helped by the hostess and staff.

When my group got there, we was immediately greeted by the front staff. Told them I have been communicating with the event planner to have the semi private room reserved for 17 guest. The hostess asked if we wanted the private room
Because they spoke to the manager. I said yes of course if it's available.

I know serving 17 guest at a table will be hard but kudos to our waitress, she was amazing! Very professional and was very attentive. Im so glad I chose this place for breakfast.

FOOD : their pho broth is so good... It's both rich and clean. They use the flat pho noodles you see in Vietnam (more traditional) compare to the thin ones you see at other places. Most at the table got the Pho Beef Rib with filet mignon. For $22? Such a steal. I do wish that they gave more pho noodles... But overall, it's one of the best pho I ever had. We ordered so many apps from Shu Mai to crispy shrimp balls, so excited I forgot to take pictures!

DRINKS : we tried the Smokey old fashioned. For $20? It was ok. I can't complain because usually Old Fashioned go for $20. I didn't really taste the Smokey ness..

Overall, if I'm In the area, I would definitely come back. Highly recommend it!",Food - Pho broth rich and clean||Drinks - Smokey old fashioned not great 
1618 Asian Fusion,"If you haven't been here this is your SIGN! Somehow after two years in Austin I hadn't had time to check this place out and boy am I regretting it!

Decent amount of free parking near the Amli, we didn't have any issues finding a spot. The place itself feels kind of tucked away, yet you wander in upon this oasis.

The space itself is open and filled with live plants everywhere and beautiful decor. The staff was extremely attentive, friendly, and provided great suggestions around popular dishes or their personal favorites. We had Eric and he was phenomenal!

For the meal we ordered the chicken dumplings, yellow curry, pad Thai, and the appetizer assortment bc who doesn't love apps! I can't even describe the flavors, the curry was some of the best curry I've had hands down. The app platter was 100% the way to go, lots of food, not too expensive, and you get to try one or two of each item!

The ambiance is so so nice. They had live music on Thursday night. It was really entertaining. The waiter was so nice and explained all the desserts so well. Really liked the service.

The service was great, as soon as we were seated we were asked if we are returning or new to the restaurant. Following this the menu was throughly explained to us and any questions I had. Great service and explanation to the menu! For an appetizer i got the chicken dumpling. Great dumpling and yummy filling inside. For my drink i ordered the iced thai tea. It was a hit!

1618 Asian Fusion,"I'm definitely adding this to my list of place I must go to whenever I'm in Austin. The food and drinks were amazing!

I started off with the 1618 shrimp and pork egg rolls. They were solid and packed plenty of flavor.

For my main I has the Tom Yum Coconut Fried Rice.  This was some of the best fried rice I've ever had. It was the perfect portion size, the shrimp were massive and it was so damn good! I love the presentation in the coconut, although it does make it a bit difficult to cut up the shrimp.

My cousin had the Shrimp Panang Curry and it was really good.

We also enjoyed the mimosa special they offer during lunch. It's not advertised but the hostess mentioned it when seating us.

Overall service was good. It took a while for the waitress to  take our order but otherwise no complaints.

The inside is also really nice. I definitely enjoyed the vibe.

They have an expansive menu with different items from different parts of Asia. You're not limited to one particular region which is what I really enjoyed.

I'm looking forward to returning and trying the dim sum brunch.","Food - 1618 shrimp and pork egg rolls (solid and flavor-packed), Tom Yum Coconut Fried Rice (best fried rice, massive shrimp, really good), Shrimp Panang Curry (really good)||Ambiance - Nice vibe||Service - Good||Menu - Expansive, different items from different parts of Asia||Drinks - Mimosa special||Price - high "

1618 Asian Fusion,"Full of savory!

Went to this place for dumplings but we end up ordering General Tso and Duck Red Curry. General Tso was one of the favorites and never had a good General Tso like this here in Texas. It hits all the criteria - the freshness, the spice, the crispy chicken, and the sauce! On the other hand, duck red curry was as legit as it can taste. Been jumping to different asian restaurants and we can say this is one of our top asian restaurants.

We really enjoyed the place from the food, service, and the ambiance. The food was worthy of the price and the portion was enough. It is very neat and clean, good for casual or formal gathering.","Food - General Tso (fresh and crispy), Duck Red Curry (legit)||Price - Worthy||Ambiance - Nice||Service - Good "
1618 Asian Fusion,"This is truly an amazing restaurant!
Great customer service and superb flavor in all their cuisine.
I can't believe we don't have this in LA!

Pineapple fried rice is not too spicy but the spices used really entice your palate.

Chicken dumplings were nice and plump and packed fresh ingredients that didn't disappoint.

The top dish was the cheesecake flambÃ© because it was an experience. You can taste every bit of flavor down to the flame! This is to die for!

1618 Asian Fusion,"This is just a cute place in downtown! The decor is very modern and the servers are very helpful and friendly.
Family decided to start with the five sampler and we were amazed. Everything, I repeat everything was delicious! From the skewers that had a very different sauce to the spring rolls, which we usually are not fans as we had never found one that has real taste, but this one is really good.
For mains, the family decided to go with the pad Thai and the duck fried rice. The duck was perfectly cooked with crispy skin and tender meat. It was also well seasoned. For the pad Thai, the server mentioned that the spice level was a 2 out of 5, but we'd say it was a 3. If you're not very familiar with spicy flavor what h out for this one. Portions are big and presentation is very good.
My daughter also ordered the cafe and she liked it.

The interior is beautiful with a mix of hard and soft surfaces making it conducive to hearing your dinner guests instead of feeling like you're in an echo chamber. The lighting and music were set reasonably, which was an added bonus.

The food was very good. Everything was served at the proper temperature with dipping sauces (my favorite!) to balance each bite. The orange chicken was not too sweet, and definitely not spicy.

What made the experience even better was the exceptional service from our waiter. They were genuinely nice, attentive, and ensured that we had everything we needed throughout our meal. Their friendly and professional approach added to the overall enjoyment of our dining experience.

1618 Asian Fusion,"1618

1618 is hands down one of the best restaurants in Austin.

I have been here probably 10-15 times by now and the food never disappoints.

They have an unbelievably good happy hour ($6 cocktails!) and the food is overflowing with flavor.

I have had just about everything here but i would recommend going with a Curry (yellow is my favorite) and either Pad Thai or a Filet Mignon Stir Fry.

The desserts are nothing to be missed too. I have had the chocolate cake (not the exploding lava one) and it is just immaculate.

Probs to this family owned business for making an unbelievably tasty offering at a solid price point! The atmosphere is so great as the restaurant is packed 24/7!","Food - Yellow Curry (recommended), Pad Thai (recommended), Filet Mignon Stir Fry(recommended), Chocolate Cake (immaculate)||Ambiance - Packed restaurant||Service - Great||Price - Solid "

Great for dates, literally anything I came alone and had a great time. I had the five sampler because I wanted some bao buns and honestly I took a chance because I don't really eat meat. I didn't enjoy it much but I think it really just depends on what you like. I did enjoy the calamari very tasty. The THAI ICED TEA AND THE MANGO STICKY RICE were literally TO DIE FOR. Highly suggest those. Thank you Shaira and to this place for great late night vibes. Shaira did say the crispy chicken pad Thai was bomb and I didn't get to try but honestly I suggest it lol.

Eruption chocolate: huge portion. You might want to share it with someone. It's not a 5-star though. There's not much chocolate oozing out of the cake. It's a little bit too sweet.
Crab fried rice with truffle: it's not on their regular menu. You will find it on happy hour menu. It's amazing. The portion is not too big, but it's an enjoyable size","Food - Eruption chocolate (huge portion, bit too sweet), Crab fried rice with truffle (amazing)||Ambiance - Enjoyable "
1618 Asian Fusion,"Duck curry: yummy. Perfectly balanced. It's not too greasy. I wish there's more duck meat though.

Coconut fried rice: coconut smell overwhelmed in a good way.

Duck dumpling noodle: it's a 6/5 dish. There's nothing to complain about. It's authentic. Again, I wish there's more duck meat though, but duck is pricey to begin with, so I understand why they didn't put too much in.

Pho 75 during happy hour: BE AWARE. the portion is for kid (or merely an appetizer for an adult). The bowl is super tiny. I can't complain on the quality though, it's not authentic but still super tasty.

Mount Everest Cheesecake: it comes with a show. They burned the wine on the cheesecake and then extinguished the fire with ice cream. It's super delicious though. It's a bit pricey but you will get a whole show. I say it's so worth the price.","Food - Duck curry (yummy, perfectly balanced), Coconut fried rice (pleasant coconut aroma), Duck dumpling noodle (authentic, exceptional), Pho 75 (small portion, tasty), Mount Everest Cheesecake (delicious, bit pricey)||Ambiance - Nice||Service - Superb "

This is a nice fancy Asian restaurant, but the price is still very reasonable for the quality.
The restaurant is huge. It's well decorated.
10/10 for the service. Everyone is friendly, from the host to the server to the bartender. There's nothing to complain.

1618 Asian Fusion,"This unassuming strip mall (with limited retail parking) under the AMLI apartment building off Riverside Drive went under my radar for far too long! I'd ordered some 1618 via ubereats, and when that went well (but not before showing up unannounced to discover this spot already had enough street cred to generate a sizeable wait time), we called ahead and found free spots at the bar one night to have our maiden in-person experience here!  

From the dÃ©cor to the hospitality, the mood was set. Loved the interesting lines of the interior design and the wine room in the midst of the dining room! There's even a stay for... live music and other acts?! Yesss!

And on to the food. Since we'd had to wait a hot minute, we decided to share a smattering of options. And when I say this place has food on par with Lin Dim Sum and Julie's Noodles, I MEAN IT!

The scallion pancakes are instantly (and maybe permanently) my favorite of anywhere I've had them. Usually super-thin and crispy and far from substantial, the scallion pancakes here were pillowy-soft, dimensional, and oh so divine!  Will ALWAYS get more in the future! -- 14/10

The pork, shrimp & shiitake Sui Mai (3-pc order) were ample and well filled, but I've just never been big on this flavor combo, though I'd still say they were ""pretty good"" -- 8/10

Now dem Xiao Long Bao (5-pc order)... holy pork soup dumplings on a spoon...!  I'd say on par IF NOT BETTER THAN Lin/ Julie's. Bigger bite for sure, and I think I could easily take down a few orders solo!  Definitely contenders here, and they've got these on the Dim sum brunch menu for a STEAL at $11! -- 14/10

The clay pot sticky rice I was ""meh"" about, I think mainly because I'm not big on Chinese sausage... but my honey liked it quite a lot!  -- 7/10 (for me)

Mango sticky rice was served beautifully, but I didn't love it. I dunno why... I'll try it once more before I even rate it..  maybe it just failed to be amazing following one of the best desserts of my life--

The Flambeau Everest cheesecake, fired with vanilla honey liqueur, cinnamon is sprinkled over it as the flames engulf the plate & topped with a scoop of coconut pineapple ice cream...... OK I need to go get another one soon after describing it alone!  I am a cheesecake aficionado, and this one absolutely, unequivocally takes the LITERAL cake!  What a whirlwind of unexpectedly epic deliciousness on a spoon!  -- 15/10

Seriously.
Deliriously.

1618 Asian Fusion,"Took my family for an early Mother's Day. The live music was amazing and created an amazing vibe for the restaurant. It is such a homey yet up-scale place that was beautiful.

We ordered calamari and grilled octopus. The batter for the calamari is soooo good and the salt,pepper,lemon dip adds the best type of flavor. The grilled octopus was on a stick and had a good Smokey flavor. Both great. We also ordered the papaya salad with shrimp. It was very refreshing and crunchy with the fish sauce smell but not super overpowering fish sauce taste. Very good!

For mains we got the L redfish and duck fried rice. So so so good. Only thing is I wish the tables were a little bigger since their food is a lot of family style options. But the food was amazing. The redfish belly was so so caramelized and crispy. I will now always crave this. The fried rice was good flavor. Very authentic since I'm very picky about fried rice. I was able to take both's leftovers to go and it was just as good the next day. We also got some stir fry which has good flavor and came with white rice.

We ended with the flaming cheesecake. Our server did it table side and it was an entertainment in itself. Very good and light.

Our server was great as all. Very attentive. The place is pretty busy so he was always running around, but overall he was able to answer all our questions and keep us satisfied for dinner.

1618 Asian Fusion,"Management - Please Read! Nobody needs or wants to hear a violin at 1000 decibels as they try to have dinner on a Thursday night in an Asian restaurant. It's piercing, it's annoying. Even worse it's so off tune. The severs are yelling at you. The music is way over amplified. If I wanted to go see a concert I'd be at a concert.

1618 Asian Fusion,"The food was ok, but nothing spectacular. I have probably been spoiled by Cali Asian cuisine. I have had much better. Don't let the high ratings fool you too.

We ordered the appetizer sampler. My companion hated the pork and gave them all to me. I thought the best item was the egg rolls but how can you screw those up. Papaya salad was good but again, pretty standard Asian fare.

Service was ok. Server was a bit robotic when we were asking for recommendations.

1618 Asian Fusion,"1618 Asian Fusion is an upscale Asian fusion restaurant that takes the best parts of common Asian dishes and elevates them.  This is not your mom's Vietnamese pho, and that's a good thing.  Some purists may not like the elevated twists, but to me 1618 is worth a visit.

My Overall Rating - 4 Stars (Atmosphere, Service, Food, Return)

Atmosphere - On the outside, 1618 Asian Fusion is as unassuming as it's name.  But inside it's a large, open space.  There's a desk dedicated to To Go orders (expertly packaged), and a stage that features live entertainment.  We were treated to a fantastic acoustic set which really accentuated the cool vibe.  1 Star.

Service - Our server was very good.  Attentive, friendly, and a great conversationalist.  No issue at all.  I would have liked the servers to explain the dishes that we ordered, since this is a high end restaurant with unique dishes.  1/2 Star.

Food - The word Fusion is in the name of the restaurant because Asian Fusion serves dishes inspired from many Southeast Asian Countries like Vietnam and Thailand.  I started with the Fried Calamari, which is served in a traditional Vietnamese style. The outside was light and crispy.  I loved it because it was the perfect example of taking a traditional dish and elevating it.  The Pho Rib is served with huge beef ribs and the pho broth is poured over in a tea kettle.  Again, this is not your mom's pho.  It was elevated and familiar at the same time.  The only letdown was the Pineapple Fried Rice.  It was just ok - order it for your IG feed, not your belly.  I have to give a bonus shout out to the To Go order.  We ordered a Pho Combo to go, and they expertly packaged it up.  Finally, Asian Fusion isn't cheap.  Don't except to eat the pho every day.  1  1/2 Stars.

Will I Return? - Yes.  The atmosphere is great.  The service is great.  The food is familiar and unique at the same time.  There are many more dishes I want to try.  I'll be back. 1 Star.

My Yelp Rating Scale (Sum of all parts):
1 Star - Atmosphere - Is it a cool dive?  Perhaps an upscale place?  No matter the type, atmosphere plays a big part and I'll give a star if I like it or thinks it has great charm.
1 Star - Service - You can have a great meal with bad service.  But that's also what can make a five star joint drop to four.  It's important to the dining experience that service is great and on point.
2 Stars - Food - I'll award up to two stars for the food, since this is the main reason we dine out.  Sometimes the extra star is given for value, but it's really all about the food.
1 Star - Will I come back? - If I know for a fact I'll return, I'll give this a star. A place has to make an impression for me to return.

Each Category can be given up to 1 star except food (2 stars) because I consider all these categories important to the overall dining experience.  I will sum them up to provide my final Yelp score.",Food - 2/2||Service - 1/2||Ambiance - 1

1618 Asian Fusion,"Very solid! I was a bit skeptical to be honest given the fusion aspect of this place with its broad pan-Asian menu but consider me impressed! The oxtail in the oxtail pho was cooked well and the meat was incredibly tender. I'm looking forward to trying the beef rib pho next time (though I might need to show a bit earlier since apparently they run out of it).

My friend had the crispy chicken pad Thai and I thought that dish was definitely a standout. I normally am not big on pad Thai but in all honesty, it didn't taste like pad Thai at all (which to me was a good thing). It was definitely a crispy version of something Thai-tasting but without the sour flavors of fish sauce and vinegar, so maybe more like a crispy pad woon sen or crispy pad thai? Either way, it was A+.","Food - Oxtail pho (cooked well with tender meat), Crispy chicken pad Thai (standout, not like traditional pad Thai, very delicious)||Ambiance - Cozy and inviting||Service - Friendly and attentive "
1618 Asian Fusion,"After my first visit I wasn't sure if I would return, I did. And I couldn't be more pleased! The dragon fruit drink was beyond delicious! The jasmine syrup was a bit too much. The spices were absolutely DIVINE! The waitstaff was attentive, respectful and all round stellar.
The only negative was the packed house was extremely hot. And the flamed drinks and burning of spice over cheesecake was difficult to tolerate. Being an asthmatic it was difficult to enjoy meal but I pushed through. I would ask they be mindful of guest that can't inhale smoke or are allergic to toxic smoke from burning food items. Covering the windows make eliminate excessive heat. Otherwise a well worth visit!","Food - Dragon fruit drink (beyond delicious, jasmine syrup a bit too much, spices DIVINE)||Service - Attentive, respectful||Ambiance - Nice, extremely hot inside "
1618 Asian Fusion,"It took over 30 minutes to actually receive my original order.

Good ambiance though. I personally wouldn't come back. [/INST]"
1618 Asian Fusion,"1618 is great! A few stand out dishes I've had are the Vietnamese bowl with pork and egg rolls, and the soup dumplings. The soup dumpling broth was SO flavorful. Some of the classic dishes like sesame chicken and orange chicken aren't really worth the upcharge of it being in a more upscale restaurant since it tastes the same as any other Asian restaurant really.

1618 Asian Fusion,"I heard 1618 Asian Fusion is the sister restaurant to 888 Pan Asian Restaurant, so I had to try it out!

Coming in, the service is amazing. We checked in through our reservations made on Yelp and we're seated immediately. If you were a walk-in, there was about an hour wait. The restaurant was fancy and very nice, we also had live music! What I loved about the live music was that it wasn't so loud to where my table couldn't hear each other, it was great!

My family ordered Mi Kho, Filet Mignon Pepper Steak, Combo Fried Rice, Thai Crispy Red Snapper (size L). From all of the food we ate, the Thai Crispy Red Snapper was the best; It was large, crispy, and the tamarind sauce was yummy! The Filet Mignon Pepper Steak came second, the steak was delicious. The conbo fried rice was okay, not the best but good. The Mi Kho unfortunately was not the greatest; The sauce was too strong and it just tasted like someone poured a lot of soy sauce and the pork belly was off, it tasted like tofu.

Overall, I would come back to try more different items like their pho (which they're known for)! I would recommend the Red Snapper for sure :)","Food - Thai Crispy Red Snapper (best), Filet Mignon Pepper Steak (delicious), Combo Fried Rice (good), Mi Kho (not the greatest, sauce too strong, port belly was off)||Ambiance - Fancy, live music, not too loud "
1618 Asian Fusion,"Food (5/5 stars):
1618 Asian Fusion made it to Yelp's Top 100 US Restaurants list, so we had to try even though we had to get takeout and eat it on the plane  Their Pad Thai was an explosion of flavor -- citrus, spice, nutty, savory, sweet. And the tofu was cooked very well. It wasn't my absolute favorite Pad Thai, but it was still amazing and would want to try their eclectic range of dishes when I'm back in Austin.

Experience (5/5 stars):
* Price: kinda pricey, but worth
* Wait Time: we scheduled our takeout and it was on time

1618 Asian Fusion,"Definitely late to the party coming here but so glad we did make it here on Valentine's Day. The place was decorated with hearts and 80's ballads were playing.

We started off with the 1618 egg rolls. Love the presentation of the dish and the egg rolls are definitely not what I expected. The rolls were tasty and crispy. Next, we tried the soup dumplings. Delicious. I like that they gave us a plate with sauces to dip in. Presentation was definitely on point with the next dishes. We tried the Tom yum fried rice, four seasons duck and pepper steak. Everything was full of flavor and I was worried about the duck being sweet with the lychee. It was not at all. It was very good. I am always afraid of trying Asian fusion places, but this place knows what they are doing. Presentation and flavor did not come short. They offer free garage parking.","Food - 1618 egg rolls (tasty and crispy), Soup dumplings (delicious, flavorful broth), Tom yum fried rice (flavorful), four seasons duck (flavorful), pepper steak (flavorful)||Ambiance - Decorated with hearts, 80's ballads playing||Service - Friendly and attentive "

Do I need to say more? We have visited the restaurant a few times, and always had exactly the same top-notch experience. This restaurant does not have an ""off"" night. During one of our visits, we chatted with a waitress who said she's been working there for a few years and has no plans on leaving because she's been treated right by the owners. That just shows how good management trickles into all aspects of the business.

1618 Asian Fusion,"1618 is always a solid restaurant. I remember the first time I went years ago, I was a bit skeptical as anything fusion usually tends to not be good when you try to do everything... 1618 is the exception to this. Despite doing a span of different Asian dishes, everything's is always consistently good. I have had their chicken red curry (beautifully plated with unexpected mushrooms), Peking duck (one of the best I've had, filet mignon pho (the most tender cut I'd meat), crispy fish (really unique with DIY rice rolls), among others...

I have also been for dim sum, which while good, is a bit overpriced. I prefer their regular menu.","Food - Chicken Red Curry (Beautifully Plated with Unexpected Mushrooms), Peking Duck (One of the Best), Filet Mignon Pho (Tender), Crispy Fish (Unique with DIY Rice Rolls), Dim Sum (Good but Overpriced)||Price - high "
1618 Asian Fusion,"This restaurant wholeheartedly deserves its spot on this year's Yelp 100.

I went last month for a business dinner while in Austin. It must have been at least a dozen of us, so they gave us a snazzy private room. We even had our own waitress, Jen, who somehow coordinated others to help her and we never wanted for anything.

So we went on a Wednesday on a reservation. Would probably suggest you making a reservation, especially given this restaurant's latest news of being on the Yelp 100. It is busy, busy!

On Wednesdays, they have some happy hour where you get major deals on wine. We did not partake, given the context of the dinner, but some did join in with a cocktail or two. I abstained. I'm admittedly not much of a drinker.

While I cannot tell you what every single person ordered, I can tell you that a month later, we are still dreaming about their soup dumplings. While I may have had some before, they don't compare to the ones at this restaurant. They are perfectly seasoned and just like having little savory marshmallows in your mouth (if such a thing exists, after all).

We had some other appetizers, mainly a platter with variety including other dumplings, fried goodies, and I forget what else. For our entrees, pho was quite popular, as were the noodle and rice dishes. I, myself, had a salt and pepper shrimp rice dish that I thought wouldn't fill me and I was deceived. It looks small, but it will fill you. The spicy sauce, too, was delectable.

For dessert, we had the chocolate mousse and a flaming cheesecake. The presentation for that flaming cheesecake was beautiful, and I recommend this if you like a show and love pineapple. I love a show but hate pineapple, so I took a bite and called it a day. The chocolate mousse in comparison while good wasn't a stunner; most, if not all minus me, preferred the cheesecake. Ultimately, this was my favorite restaurant in Austin and I would love to return, especially for those soup dumplings. Yum, yum.","Food - Soup dumplings (perfectly seasoned), Appetizers (variety), Salt and pepper shrimp rice (filling), Flaming cheesecake (recommended), Chocolate mousse (good but not a stunner)||Service - Coordinated, friendly, attentive "
1618 Asian Fusion,"Ahhhhh omg, this place. Where to begin. The ambience was nice, slightly upscale but in a casual way. Very high quality food. Everything was very fresh, piping hot and well curated. M

Calamari- YOU MUST GET THIS. Is a small portion, maybe two people can share this. If more than 2 people get multiple orders cause you will want to scarf this down. If I had known how delicious it was I would have gotten like 3 orders for myself....they season it so well. Perfectly cooked. It practically melted in my mouth. They serve it with this really nice coconut milk based dipping sauce. YUM

Sesame chicken - very crunchy, very sticky, sweet and served with rice and grilled pineapple. DELICIOUS.

Lemongrass chicken vermicelli bowl- piping hot, perfectly cooked chicken. The lemongrass wasn't overpowering. The portion size was very big. I had to take half to go.

Soup dumplings- these were very underwhelming for me. Idk if it was just me but they were pretty bland and just meh. I had no interested in eating a second one.

Last but certainly not least, Chow, our server was THE BEST. such a sweet guy. We spent a lot of time talking to him. Very great guy with a really great head on his shoulders.

1618 Asian Fusion,"We've been dining with these fine folks since summer 2021. Previously, their execution was flawless. We have now had two orders where this wasn't the case. The fried rice in last night's order would've been embarrassing if they had served it to a client of mine. The shrimp was old and the fried rice wasn't properly cooked.

They also don't actually reply to direct messages trying to seek discussion of this sort of problem.

1618 Asian Fusion,"Celebrated my fourth anniversary with my man with my favorite meal of the week, brunch!  I had never had dim sum, but he has, so we decided to try the dim sum brunch. First of all, there were so many options!  I wanted to try everything!  Unfortunately, I can't possibly in one meal, but the nice thing about dim sum is that you can try several things without stuffing yourself miserable.

We started with the soup dumplings, but they were so good, we finished them before grabbing a photo. Next up, the sugar cane shrimp which were phenomenal, and a suggestion from our server. The appetizer sampler really put us over the top on fullness, after also eating the shrimp with bamboo dumplings. Everything was so fresh tasting, with obvious care and attention in preparation. I can't speak to the authenticity, but having recently been voted 22 in the country, they are obviously doing it right!  

I want to compliment our server, who spaced out our dishes as requested, giving us ample time to enjoy and savor each bite without feeling rushed.

Also, the decor of the space is modern and sexy with curved wood ribbons, beautiful lighting and thoughtful accents.

Pros:
+ Vietnamese coffee was DELICIOUS! It was very strong and one of the best bios of coffee that I've had here
+ A side of bok choy was $4 and they gave you quite a bit, which I then added to the wonton soup
+ Plating was beautiful, definitely a place to bring guests to
- Salted egg bun was solid. If you haven't had this before, I would recommend getting it. It's custardy and sweet but not too sweet.

Cons:
- Ordered the wonton soup under the appetizer section, I wish I caught that it didn't say noodles in the description. Ordering the one with the noodles was an extra $3-4.
- The wonton soup was a little too salty for me, I think it may be coming from the bits of bacon that are cooked into the wonton.

Overall, I think this was a cool place and worth coming by for coffee. I would play around with either the salt level or dishes to find something that matched my pallet more.","Food - Vietnamese coffee (delicious, strong), Bok Choy (good portion, added to Wonton soup), Salted egg bun (solid, not too sweet), Wonton soup (too salty, excessive bacon)||Ambiance - Beautiful||Service - Friendly, attentive||Price - Extra charge for noodles in Wonton soup||Salts - Excessive "
1618 Asian Fusion,"I was pleasantly surprised at the food quality and taste. Truth be told, I am not a big fan of fusion food, especially with Asian cuisines that tend to fall flat in Austin *ahem*

Xiao long bao was decent, they are juicy and flavorful. I have only had good xiao long bao at Din Tai Fung and these taste really good compared to DTF (the wrap is a little thicker)

Matcha salad was refreshing with the blueberries and raspberries, pairing with sweet matcha sauce. They have sliced almonds and crunchy tofu in it as well, quite inventive and yummy.

The Hanoi Phá»Ÿ has really good broth, it's probably the best broth I have tried in Austin so far - coming from a Hanoian. The filet mignon and brisket was so tender, it was dreamy... I didnt order onions cause we don't have that in Hanoi and also have my bean sprouts steamed too. Love that they offer that option :)

1618 Asian Fusion,"A really nice Asian fusion restaurant, mixing Vietnamese, Thai, Singaporean, and Chinese food styles! Apparently, it was listed on Yelp's top 100 in 2023!

AMBIENCE  5/5
The ambience is excellent. I can't comment about parking as I Ubered here. But from the moment you walk in, you are greeted by a hostess, who adds you onto a electronic waitlist. The day I went, was extra poppin and I had to wait an hour and a half.

When you're seated, it is essentially mood lighting, with a nice, colorful modern design, with a touch of industrial (lots of wood accents).

FOOD   4/5 Total Price: $88 without tip
I'm starting with the end in mind... dessert..
The UBE Panna Cotta ($10) was THE STAR of the show. Absolutely brought my rating of this place up from a teetering 7 to an 8

Calamari salted pepper ($10) "" lightly, battered and fried squid"" with some coconuty pepper sauce...BOMB. This was actually very tasty - not too heavy/oily, nicely flavored batter that e corporates garlic! Yum

Wings ($13) Bangkok (Tom Yum)  more sour and spicy, Yummy flavorrr... The wings came out piping hot, they were a really nice spicy/sour and tangy. Also, these were pretty substantial, not those tiny pipsqueak wings!

Xiao long Bao ($12) pork soup dumplings - these are pretty standard but still really good. The skin was a little bit thicker, but you can tell that they were made with love/handmade.

Green curry fillet mignon ($19) delicious with red bell peppers, onions, eggplant, mushrooms, and lemon grass, such spicey and tasty goodness! But a bit salty by the end of the meal... or maybe MSG idk ahha

Duck Pho ($17)
So Tasty!!! But also quite salty!  This was quite delicious... It tasted kind of like a duck Ramen (noodles) and also had a few wonton in it. The duck slices were plentiful, and very tender! Also a bit salty or MSG-y by the end of drinking half the soup!

SERVICE  5/5
Service was overall great! Our server was really nice and We received some great recommendations from her, and she was very enthusiastic! You can tell that the owners pride themselves on the unique dishes and flavors.

1618 Asian Fusion,"Been here a bunch of times and it's wonderful every time! Not only is the food delicious but they make every meal an experience! Coconut water served in an actual coconut, pineapple fried rice served in a pineapple and a dessert on fire. This is where we bring guests when we want to WOW them with food and an experience.

1618 Asian Fusion,"I have driven 30 minutes into Austin at least five time to eat at this location; celebrated two birthdays, two date nights and a Mother's Day dinner because we cannot get enough!
I ordered the coconut fried rice this time, but I have had the pineapple fried rice too and they are both beautifully served inside the fruit shell. Every detail about this restaurant is thought out and they have great drink options for drinkers and non drinkers. The service is always above and beyond. Sometimes they even have live musicians play in the restaurant, but my favorite spot to sit is the patio on a sunny day.
If you're looking for a place to celebrate or impress someone new, please check them out! I'd make a reservation if it's dinner time.","Food - Coconut fried rice (beautifully served inside the fruit shell), Pineapple fried rice (beautifully served inside the fruit shell)||Service - Above and beyond||Ambiance - Thought out||Drinks - Great||Location - Nice patio "
1618 Asian Fusion,"Fantastic fusion Asian that works extremely well for vegetarians, vegans, pescaterians and meat eaters alike.  Our party of 11 loved everything we ordered.  Special favorites from the dim sum menu included the pork soup dumplings, charred octopus and egg custard bao.  The vegetarian entrees were all fantastic - tofu yellow curry, veggie fried rice (the veggie were grilled in the most delicious way!), the vegan noodles (esp when paired with the yellow curry) and papaya salad.  The panang salmon was excellent.  The only item we ordered that I would skip are the veggie dumplings.

Prices are reasonable, service is good, the atmosphere is nice and the location within walking distance of the river is just perfect.  I will definitely be back when I am in Austin next!","Food - Pork Soup Dumplings (loved), Charred Octopus (loved), Egg Custard Bao (loved), Tofu Yellow Curry (fantastic), Veggie Fried Rice (fantastic), Panang Salmon (excellent), Vegetable Dumplings (skip), Papaya Salad (fantastic), Pot Stickers (good), Shrimp Har Gow (good), Baby Bok Choi (good)||Price - Reasonable||Service - Good||Atmosphere - Nice||Location - Perfect||Menu - Dim Sum (loved), Fusion||Menu - Vegetarian (fantastic), Vegan Noodles (excellent), Panang Salmon (excellent)||Menu - Fish (excellent)||Menu - Meat (good)||Menu - Soup (loved), Dumplings (good)||"

"
1618 Asian Fusion,"Was craving some Asian food while we were visiting Austin and came across this page on yelp and it looked really good.  It's located next to an apartment complex and they don't really have many parking spaces.  We came here for lunch on a Monday and luckily we were able to find parking.  

The interior of the restaurant was decorated with Christmas decorations throughout.  There was also a stage with a microphone, I believe they might have some live music for dinner?  The restaurant looks very updated and contemporary inside, they also have a full bar as well.  Our server was in-training, but she was very nice and helpful and answered all of our questions we had about the menu.

I ordered the Hanoi Coffee and it was delicious.  There was like an egg mixture foam on top of the coffee that added a nice creamy texture.  It was served hot and also had a little cookie placed inside the coffee as well.  

The duck skewers were really good.  It's basically ground up duck meat that they wrapped around lemongrass and grilled it.  It came with a vietnamese fish sauce that you can use to dip the skewers in.

The banh trang was probably my favorite dish of the meal.  It's basically rice paper that's grilled on a pan and topped with ground pork, green onions, ground shrimp, with like a spicy mayo sauce spread across, and topped with some basil.  It's like a vietnamese pizza.  The rice paper was crispy when you bit into it and the pork and sauce combined together made it like a flavor bomb.  I highly recommend this dish!

The Hu Tieu was a solid dish.  My wife really enjoyed it.  It came with dry noodles with an assortment of topping and soup on the side.  The dumplings were really good in the noodle dish.

The duck curry was pretty decent.  The duck meat was boneless which made it really easy to eat as a curry dish.  However, I thought the curry had too much coconut milk that I mostly tasted coconut flavor in the curry rather than the actually curry flavor itself.  I should've tried a different dish, but curry sounded good at the time.

Overall, I think this is a solid place.  The food is good and the service is great!","Food - Hanoi Coffee (delicious, egg mixture foam, hot), Duck Skewers (good), Banh Trang (favorite, crispy rice paper, ground pork, green onions, ground shrimp, spicy mayo sauce), Hu Tieu (solid, dry noodles, good dumplings), Duck Curry (decent, boneless duck, too much coconut milk)||Ambiance - Updated, contemporary, Christmas decor||Service - Great||Parking - Limited||Menu - Huge "
1618 Asian Fusion,"1618 Asian Fusion is great. They have a mix of different Asian cuisines, which usually is a red flag for me, but everything that we ordered was cooked to perfection with good flavors. The ambiance of the restaurant is very nice with lots of seats available and a bar. It would be a good place to do group dinners or parties.

We ordered the Xiao Long Bao, Pho Shrimp, and Chicken Crispy PadThai. The Chicken Crispy Pad Thai was especially delicious with a slight kick of spice. The drinks we ordered were the two refreshers, and I would definitely recommend the Lemongrass Tangerine Refresher. The Dragonfuirt Rose Refresher has a strong rose scent, so it might not be for everyone. The menu was extensive, and if I had a extra stomach I would have loved to try more things from it.

There is a parking lot available as well, which is always a plus! If I ever visit Austin again, I will probably visit 1618 Asian Fusion again.","Food - Xiao Long Bao (great), Pho Shrimp (great), Chicken Crispy PadThai (delicious, slightly spicy), Lemongrass Tangerine Refresher (recommended), Dragonfruit Rose Refresher (strong rose scent)||Ambiance - Nice||Parking - Available||Service - Friendly and attentive "
1618 Asian Fusion,"My husbands coworker recommended his place, especially the cocktails.
Not gonna I thought the food was gonna be bland.
Boy was I wrong!
I got the crunchy pad Thai and it was really good. I have a hard time finding good pad Thai, it has a kick but the more you eat it it gets spicier.
My husband got the Duck PhÃ³, it was full of flavor!  
I want to thank our server Marvy, such a wonderful lady, she went beyond!
My husband can't eat pork, she took the time to find out and notify us the the phÃ³ wontons indeed come with pork (pork &shrimp) thank you  
Oh, the tropical Asia cocktail is a must try!!!
The only bad thing I have to say is that is was warm inside I can't wait to try their other dishes","Food - Crunchy Pad Thai (really good, gets spicier the more you eat), Duck PhÃƒÂ© (full of flavor)||Service - wonderful, helpful with the menu||Ambiance - Warm "
1618 Asian Fusion,"Date night on a Thursday (note that they had great live music).

To start with drinks, the Tropical Asian (refreshing mango) and the Bramble Lush (mojito-like) were great picks.

For an appetizer we ordered the Xiao Long Bao (pork soup dumplings) which were very good!

For the entrÃ©es, the Chicken Pad Thai and the Filet Mignon Stir-Fry were excellent options.

Overall the service, ambiance, food, and drinks were top notch. I would recommend this spot if you're looking for a quality Asian-Fusion experience!","Food - Xiao Long Bao (very good), Tropical Asian (refreshing), Bramble Lush (great), Chicken Pad Thai (excellent), Filet Mignon Stir-Fry (excellent)||Service - Top notch||Ambiance - Great||Drinks - Tropical Asian (refreshing), Bramble Lush (mojito-like)||Music - Live "
1618 Asian Fusion,A great date night spot. Having a live musician is a great addition to any restaurant. The steamed chicken dumplings were mouth watering and the steak fried rice was delicious. The general tso's chicken was dry and wasn't spicy at all. The service was great. I'll be back.,"Food - Steamed Chicken Dumplings (Mouth-watering), Steak Fried Rice (Delicious), General Tso's Chicken (Dry and not spicy)||Service - Great||Ambiance - Live music is a great addition||Location - Great spot for date night "
1618 Asian Fusion,"We came to Austin for an event and so we really only had 2 meals to eat out during our weekend.  1618 Asian Fusion was one of those places and we chose wisely.  We could only get super early reservation (4:30) so we asked our waitress if it was alright if we had a couple of cocktails before ordering our food since it wasn't busy yet. She was more than understanding and said if we needed her for anything to just make eye contact.  Otherwise, she respectively left us alone until a bit later when we were ready to order and not once did we feel rushed.

When it came time to eat we ordered their Banh Trang Da Nang (Viet pizza), Duck Curry, and the Saigon Grilled Lamb Rack.  The lamb and duck were cooked perfectly and the Viet pizza was a great way to start the dinner.  While it was a bit on the pricey side, we felt it was worth it since everything was done so well. One thing I liked about the menu here is how fusion-y it is. Most fusion restaurants get it all wrong with having way too many different options and all of which are just mediocre. The food here (and the drinks) were all very well done and all stood out from each other.  And while they specialize more in Vietnamese cuisine, they have a few other Asian specialties (dim sum, roast duck, Pad Thai, etc.) I have no doubt their pho is fire.

Love the ambiance and our server. We had a lovely date night and I would come back here.","Food - Banh Trang Da Nang (Viet pizza), Duck Curry, Saigon Grilled Lamb Rack||Ambiance - Lovely||Service - Lovely||Price - high "
1618 Asian Fusion,"Unfortunately, I could not finish my meal, due to it being so filling. However the food was cooked perfectly and I don't think I've ever been so pleased with this meal, especially their curries.

It was absolutely beautiful and I wish I could finish every bite. Turned a rough day into a pleasant one, thank you so very much.","Food - Curries (beautiful, filled with flavor)||Service - Excellent "
1618 Asian Fusion,"My boyfriend and I dined here last night for the first time and everything was phenomenal from beginning to end! We had the lemongrass duck skewers and calamari to start and both were amazing. For entrees, we had the whole red snapper, lamb rack, and Peking duck. The red snapper was my favorite, but everything we tried was so delicious, we'll definitely be back for more! The best part of the entire experience, however, was definitely our server, Ana. She was so funny, attentive, and made our night so much more enjoyable!! Thank you Ana!!","Food - Lemongrass Duck Skewers (phenomenal), Calamari (amazing), Whole Red Snapper (favorite), Lamb Rack (delicious), Peking Duck (delicious), Server - Ana (funny, attentive)||Location - Austin, TX "

1618 Asian Fusion,"A modern twist to Asian fusion cuisine. Start with the Grilled Lemongrass Duck skewers, followed by any of their filet mignon dishes, I prefer either the green curry or stir fry onion. However, for a real treat, go to their weekend dim sum brunch and prepare to have to be wowed. The Rainbow Scallop Dumplings are a must-have, the dish is not only brought to you in an amazing display for the eyes, they melt in your mouth and please the palate to an extreme that is seldom experienced. The Shrimp Har Kaw is another dumpling that should be on your radar.

If it's a very special occasion and you have a friend, or two with you, then definitely order the Thai Crispy Red Snapper with Tamarind Sauce, an entire whole fish in three different sizes, you won't regret it. And, of course, 1618 has a variety of specialty cocktails that will stimulate your appetite and accompany your meal perfectly. We ordered the Secretini and the Doers Lycheeni that went perfectly with our meal. Finish your meal with an order of Custard Vital Egg Bao, I'm sure that you won't regret this unique dessert.","Food - Grilled Lemongrass Duck Skewers (recommended), Filet Mignon (preferred - Green Curry or Stir Fry Onion), Thai Crispy Red Snapper with Tamarind Sauce (recommended), Rainbow Scallop Dumplings (must-have), Shrip Har Kaw (recommended), Custard Vital Egg Bao (unique dessert)||Drinks - Secretini and Doers Lycheeni||Service - Perfect||Ambiance - Modern twist to Asian fusion cuisine "
1618 Asian Fusion,"Went twice in a week to make sure my experience wasn't a fluke. It wasn't.

I thought it was expensive for Asian food. Flavors were just okay. Nothing really wowed me, although the server was lovely and the flambÃ©ed cheesecake was cool.

1618 Asian Fusion,"This was my favorite dinner while in Austin, TX! Both food and service was great, with a plus that the menu clearly stated what menu items were gluten free. Our server was knowledgeable on the menu and made great suggestions based on our likes. We got the duck lemongrass skewers and the salt & pepper calamari (these two items alone had me hooked), the pineapple fried rice with duck and shrimp, and the oxtail pho with meatballs added. They didn't have gluten free hoisin but provided a spice sauce that i could use in its place. While everything was amazing, the pho broth is what really blew me away. It was so well balanced and fragrant I almost didn't add the spiced sauce they gave me. It was also the irst time i've had oxtail in my pho and will now be on the look out for anyone who does make this!","Food - Duck Lemongrass Skewers (great), Salt & Pepper Calamari (hook), Pineapple Fried Rice with Duck and Shrimp (good), Oxtail Pho with Meatballs (impressive broth)||Service - Knowledgeable, helpful with recommendations||Menu - Gluten-free options "

1618 Asian Fusion,"I am not typically an Asian Fusion fan but WOW! I can understand why they are in the top 100 places to eat in Austin!

Absolutely everything we ate was delicious. The drinks were amazing and priced well for the size.

We ordered pretty much everything from the menu and shared it all. Different Pho, curries, the rainbow dumplings, the sampler appetizers, two ordered of soup dumplings and a cheesecake.

The soup dumplings were insane! So good! My daughter and her bf haven't stopped talking about them and they are already planning to go back.

The ambiance was so perfect! They had a great singer on stage and he was low enough we could hold conversations but loud enough we could sing along.

1618 Asian Fusion,Absolutely love it here!!! I moved here a month ago and I've probably been here about 5 times. I usually sit alone at the bar and never have to wait.

1618 Asian Fusion,"This place is a foodie dream - some of the food is fairly basic Asian fusion, but they do it quite well (although can be a bit salty). We made reservations in advance as this place is quite popular, even on Monday, for 6pm, which is just in time to get the opportunity to order some items off the happy hour menu which happens Monday-Thursday 4:30-6:30pm.

We got the Bramble Lush, 1618 Paloma, Licor 43 Shot, and Limoncello Shot to start off for the happy hour. The Bramble Lush sounded basic but the blackberry and mint made it very delicious. It was also pretty because they added the Tito's 50mL vodka bottle in it. The shots were also pretty because they add a bubble on top (although it was easily popped).

We also got the salmon tom kha off the HH menu, which was quite rich and tangy. Salmon was a bit overcooked but otherwise a solid starter.

From the regular menu, we got the crispy pad thai and coconut fried rice. The crispy pad thai was quite interesting - noodles were quite crispy and full of flavor, but a bit on the salty side. The accompanied bean sprouts and chicken were good. The coconut fried rice was also quite rich with strong coconut and curry flavors - they put the rice in a hollowed coconut for the aesthetic. The rice also had pineapple chunks in it.

Finally, for dessert, we decided to get the Flambeau Everest cheesecake which in itself was a nice performance. Flaming liquor poured on top of the cheesecake to burn slightly, before the fire is extinguished by a scoop of vanilla ice cream. The cheesecake itself was decent, and the outside parts that were engulfed in flames tasted like creme brÃ»lÃ©e to an extent. It is a large dessert that is meant to be shared with at least 2 people.

Service was attentive, and a lot of the items on the menu were relatively creative. This was one of the more expensive meals I ate in Austin, but it was worth the price and is actually priced around a standard dinner in Seattle.","Food - Bramble Lush (delicious, pretty presentation), 1618 Paloma (good), Licor 43 Shot (pretty), Limoncello Shot (pretty), Salmon Tom Kha (rich, tangy), Crispy Pad Thai (crunchy noodles, bit salty), Coconut Fried Rice (rich, strong coconut and curry flavors, pineapple chunks), Flambeau Everest Cheesecake (decent, engulfed in flames tasted like creme brulee)||Service - Attentive||Price - high "
1618 Asian Fusion,"Okay so, I've been in 1618 fusion plenty of times and when I tell you they do not disappoint.
My all time favorite is the filet green curry. It's spicy flavorful and filing.
But you have to start with the peppered salted calamari and the soup dumplings . You will be so satisfied and full !","Food - Peppered Salted Calamari (excellent), Soup Dumplings (excellent)||Ambiance - Cozy and inviting||Service - Friendly and attentive "
1618 Asian Fusion,"By far my favorite Asian fusion restaurant in Austin so far.
Whenever my family visits we ALWAYS take them here. It's hard to find an Asian restaurant that serves the Peking duck & cooks it correctly w/ the bao. The salt & pepper Tofu is another one of my favorites! Perfectly cooked w/ slight crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside.

Any of their soup dumplings is a must! Make sure u use the sauces correctly too!

Service is always great & quick.

Overall we just love coming here. I 100% recommend getting a reservation if you're coming fri-sunday. Trust me it's worth it!","Food - Peking duck (favorite), Salt and pepper tofu (perfectly cooked), Soup dumplings (must-try), Bao (excellent)||Service - Great||Ambiance - Lovely "
1618 Asian Fusion,"Make sure to come early since it gets pretty packed.
The indoor ambiance is very nice and they play some accoustic covers lol

We wanted to get everything but knew our stomach wouldn't be able to handle it lol we got the 5 sampler appetizer so we could try everything. My favorite was the bao! The sauce, the bun, everything was yummy!!! The egg rolls were good too and paired well with the sauces. For entree, we had the crispy pad Thai and the pho beef ribs. I'll be honest, I wasn't feeling the crispy pad Thai. They fried the noodle so much that they were hard...and make it difficult to mix with the rest of the ingredients...wasn't my thing. The pho beef rib was huge for $20. You DEFINITELY hit your protein macros on this lol the pho noodles were wider and thicker than usual. The broth was delicious! Perfect for a cold day!

Unfortunately that meant we had zero room for the flambee cheesecake. Will have to come again !","Food - Bao (yummy), Egg rolls (good), Crispy pad Thai (hard noodles, lacked flavor), Pho beef ribs (delicious broth)||Ambiance - Nice, acoustic covers||Service - Friendly "

We had the Tokyo ramune, mi kho dried noodles, and the pineapple fried rice.

Mi kho dried noodles - these were amazing. At the bottom of the bowl, there were pork belly and small crunchy bits. Very spicy, we put the chili paste and it had jalapeÃ±os. This dish had popping flavors. Highly recommended!

1618 Asian Fusion,"I went here once before and it was ""pretty good""- came here again and it was amazing! We had a large party (9) and got reservations ahead of time.

Our waiter was amazing- remembered everything, was personable, and so sweet! We had a fussy baby and he had so much patience and understanding. I got the grilled octopus, duck four season, and crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e for food. For drinks i had the key lime pie and lychee martinis.

The grilled octopus was crispy and fresh, not fishy. Octopus can be rubbery if over cooked but this was not an issue! The charred parts of the legs were amazing. Delicate with a spicy sauce. 9/10

Four season duck was amazing! A good serving size- about the size of an average chicken breast with sauce and veg underneath + white rice. The duck was juicy and savory, warm flavors with basil and slightly sweet citrus notes. Skin was to die for. Interesting fruit stir fried in that gave it complexity. 10/10

CrÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e was above average, but the difference among the table in brÃ»lÃ©ed tops was all over the board. If they spend time getting tit crispy and right, it's great! Average for the table, 7/10

Drinks were great- key lime pie martini wasn't too sweet and tasted like the pie. Lychee was fresh and light. Would order again.

Our waiter was amazing! He brought a complementary key lime pie which was so sweet and thoughtful. Great desert as well.

All in all, I'd totally come again. The ambiance was amazing and there was a stage that was set up- last time i was here there was a band, I'd love to come back and have live music.

1618 Asian Fusion,"A little hard to find but this is a good place to get Asian fusion food. I've been here on a weekday and the wait is not bad at all. But on the weekend, the wait is a little longer and it took a while for our server to come to us. This last time I tried some new dishes.
The first was the Pineapple Fried Rice. It was flavorful with pieces of duck, onion, bell pepper, basil, and pineapple. It also had slight spicy kick to it.
Next was the Roast Duck Red Curry. I really liked the curry sauce. It was creamy (and a bit spicy) that paired well with the duck, mushrooms, and onions in the dish.
Lastly I had the Banana Leaf Spicy Steam Salmon. The salmon was soft with a spicy almost curry-like sauce with onions and bell peppers.
Everything was pretty good. I'll be back but probably on a weekday when it's less crowded and I can get faster service.","Food - Pineapple Fried Rice (flavorful with duck, onion, bell pepper, and pineapple), Roast Duck Red Curry (liked the curry sauce, creamy and spicy), Banana Leaf Spicy Steam Salmon (soft, spicy almost curry-like sauce with onions and bell peppers)||Location - Hard to find||Service - slow "

1618 Asian Fusion,"5/5 Rating! Customer service was impeccable! From the hostess, to our server and the flambÃ© dessert person. They were so attentive, and welcoming.

We ordered a few dishes, everything was cook to perfection! You can not go wrong with anything on their menu. My favorite would have to be their Tom yum soup. It was rich with aromas and the best I've had by far.

Atmosphere is relaxing as there's a live band playing during dinner. You can definitely feel the owner put a lot of love and effort into their vision.","Food - Tom Yum Soup (rich and fragrant), Other dishes (cooked to perfection)||Service - Impeccable||Ambiance - Relaxing||Music - Live band "

1618 Asian Fusion,"I recently dined at 1618 Asian Fusion, a trendy and highly popular Asian fusion restaurant, and I can confidently say that it was well worth the wait. Although the long queue during dinner time might be off-putting for some, the restaurant's prime location next to Lady Bird Lake offers the perfect opportunity for a picturesque sunset stroll while waiting for your turn.

On a busy Saturday night, our group of five was 32nd in line and had to wait for about an hour. Despite the long wait, the food more than made up for it. Here's what we ordered:

Papaya Salad: This refreshing dish, with its mix of carrot, grape tomato, and shrimp, wasn't overly spicy, making it a delightful starter.
1618 Egg Rolls: A delicious combination of shrimp, pork, glass noodles, taro, and yellow onion. Wrapping them in lettuce and mint added a fresh twist to the classic egg roll.
Sugar Cane Shrimp: The three-piece serving of shrimp paste balls evoked a sense of nostalgia of what I had as a kid and was simply delectable.
Imperial Crispy Red Fish: This dish was perfect for our group, featuring a fresh battered whole redfish served with vermicelli noodles, fresh vegetables, rice paper, and fish sauce. The crispy skin and tender, bone-free fish made for a flavorful experience, and the DIY spring fish rolls added a fun element.
Filet Mignon Pepper Steak: The tender beef, stir-fried with red and green bell peppers, mushroom, and yellow onion, was cooked to perfection.
Hanoi Coffee: This unique northern Vietnamese-style coffee with espresso and egg custard was a delightful twist.
In conclusion, 1618 Asian Fusion truly lives up to its popularity. The delectable dishes and fun atmosphere make it an ideal dining destination. If you're planning to dine here, be prepared for a wait, but rest assured that it's worth every minute.","Food - Papaya Salad (refreshing), 1618 Egg Rolls (delicious), Sugar Cane Shrimp (delectable), Imperial Crispy Red Fish (flavorful), Filet Mignon Pepper Steak (tender), Hanoi Coffee (unique, delightful)||Location - Prime||Service - Friendly and attentive "

1618 Asian Fusion,"Update: I went back for dinner in mid-June when I was in town again. This time, I brought along some friends to try out the amazing food and they absolutely loved it! They raved about how delicious the food and drinks were - and these are not easy people to please! Our server was lovely and attentive. Sadly, no live performer this time (I think we went on a Tues night), but the ambiance was still as fun as ever. Everyone was friendly and attentive even though it was super busy!

We ordered multiple dishes, including the Bangkok chicken wings, banana leaf salmon, pineapple fried rice, and crispy chicken pad Thai.

1618 Asian Fusion,"We were a bit disappointed when we visited 1618 Asian Fusion. It was good - but based on the reviews, we were expecting to be blown away, and we definitely were not. That being said, the food was good. The parking super easy, which was nice. The one thing that we had that was truly excellent - possibly the best version we've ever had - was a bowl of their Tom Kha soup. It was worth going just for the soup, and if we lived nearby, I'd probably order it take out all the time!

1618 Asian Fusion,"This place has been one of the best Asian Fusion restaurants I've been to so far in Austin. They have a mixture of Vietnamese, Thai, and Chinese food. My boyfriend and I came here for lunch and ordered the Hanoi coffee, chai latte, duck skewers, soup dumplings, and orange chicken. There were no misses at all, everything was so delicious!

The Hanoi coffee was the perfect amount for a pick-me-up without being overstimulated with caffeine. It was sweet and delicious, and came with a wafer treat to pair with the coffee. It was honestly the best Vietnamese egg coffee I've ever had, and this is coming from someone who grew up in California's Little Saigon.

Everything else was amazing as well. The duck skewers were tender and well-seasoned, the soup dumplings were juicy and bursted with flavor, and the orange chicken was crispy and deliciously tangy.

I can't wait to come back and try the other dishes!","Food - Hanoi Coffee (perfect pick-me-up, sweet and delicious), Duck Skewers (Tender and well-seasoned), Soup Dumplings (Juicy and bursting with flavor), Orange Chicken (Crispy and deliciously tangy)||Ambiance - Cozy and inviting||Service - Friendly and attentive "

1618 Asian Fusion,"Very impressed by 1618 Asian Fusion! My fiancÃ© and I came on Friday around 5 pm. Unfortunately their happy hour is only Monday - Thursday from 4:30-6:30pm :(

However I throughly enjoyed the food and service! We were seated immediately and starving!! Our glasses were filled with water the entire time and consistently asked if we needed anything else.

We ordered a ton of dishes. My favorites were the crispy pad thai and the vegetable curry. This was the first time I had crispy pad thai and I'm a fan! The crispy noodles weren't that oily and full of flavor. The vegetable curry wasn't overly sweet and tasted almost smoky. I loved it!

1618 Asian Fusion,"On a Friday at 4 pm there was no wait to be seated (there is usually a long wait). The greeter was quick to get me seated.

It was a pretty loud restaurant, or maybe just the tables were too close together, either way I would describe it was loud and not exactly a relaxing vibe.

The service was very poor. Had to wait a long while (~16+ mins) after being seated for the wait staff to come take my drink order, etc. Then they didn't return again for a long time (~35 mins). When they finally returned, I ordered the Chocolate Eruption ($14) to go. I wasn't told they would not include the ice cream, so that was unfortunate to find out after getting home. The dessert was disappointing - seemed like just a bunch of frozen chocolate on top of a cold chocolate bunt cake.

The coconut rice ($20) was interesting. The rice was more ""al dente"" than I am used to - so I didn't love it. The shrimp were a good size and seasoned well. I can't say I would recommend it - but that might be mostly because of the rice.

They asked what kind of milk I wanted in the Thai tea ($6) but didn't specify that it was an up charge to change it ($1).","Food - Coconut rice (interesting, not good), Shrimp (good), Chocolate Eruption (disappointing, not included ice cream), Thai tea (high price)||Ambiance - Loud, close tables||Service - Poor, slow, did not return||Drinks - Thai tea (high price)||Menu - Coconut rice (interesting, not good), Shrimp (good)||Price - high "

1618 Asian Fusion,"Have had nothing but positive experiences at 1618! If you don't have reservations you may be waiting around for a bit or sitting at the bar. It is full service though, so not a bad choice.

I've been twice. Both times I got a different dish. I've tried the Xiao Long Bao Dim Sum, Cauliflower Garlic Vegetable entree, and the Banana Leaf Spicy Steam Salmon. I was blown away by all of these! The flavors are so rich.

Save room for dessert. Their flambeau cheesecake and crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e are beautiful!

The staff is accommodating of any food allergies - just let your waiter know. They offer impeccable service.

Parking is easy. There's a parking garage available for retail parking across the street which is convenient.

1618 Asian Fusion,"We reserved a table here for 8 people on a Tuesday night a few weeks ahead of time, using the Yelp app which was very easy. This was for a birthday dinner, but not sure that you can specify that on the reservation request.

We ordered 8 items from the menu with intention to eat family-style, and this was a good amount of food. A stand out dish for me was the pineapple fried rice, I enjoyed how they seasoned this, and it had a touch of spice I liked. The calamari was surprisingly crispy and tasty but I thought was kinda pricey based on the amount you receive. The Peking duck was good, the pieces are quite large, but missed some crunchiness on the duck skin. The legs were crispy though.

I was happy to discover they also provide key lime pie dessert as well as a celebratory birthday sing-a-long for birthday occasions. So this a solid place to celebrate your birthday. There is some parking outside the restaurant in the shared parking lot, as well as in the parking garage.

1618 Asian Fusion,"My friends talked very highly of 1618 so I guess my expectations might have been too high going in. We weren't able to get a reservation so we waited about 20-30 minutes on Friday, which was expected. The ambiance of the restaurant was very nice and fancy. The bar area was also nice! When we were dining in, there was a live singer on the stage as well.

We got crispy pad thai, regular pad thai, and 1618 egg rolls. The regular pad thai was flavorful and the crispy pad thai was unique in its own way (caution, crispy pad thai only have the deep fried noodles without regular noodles). I think the best thing we got was probably the egg rolls! They were a bit small but they were crunchy and the fish sauce was really good!! However, overall, I didn't think this place was over the top, mindblowingly good. Both pad thais were decent but it was just good for the experience. Especially considering the price and waiting time, I think they are cheaper and faster options out there.","Food - Crispy Pad Thai (unique, decent), Regular Pad Thai (flavorful), 1618 Egg Rolls (crunchy, good fish sauce), Live singer||Ambiance - Nice, Fancy||Service - Friendly and attentive "

It's slight tucked away making it a bit more difficult to spot, but there is also a parking garage making it somewhat easier to park. While I have only gotten the Filet Miglin Green Curry, I have never heard any of my friends not like anything they order so everything is relatively consistent.

LOVED the soup dumplings, it's a must get. Grilled octopus and papaya salad were both yummy too. For the main entrees, we split chicken pad Thai, Peking duck and garlic bok choy! Pad Thai was my fave it was really soooo good and the spice level was perfect. Garlic bok choy and Peking duck was also delish!","Food - Papaya salad (loved), Grilled octopus (yummy), Soup dumplings (must get), Chicken pad Thai (favorite, perfect spice), Peking duck (delish), Garlic bok choy (delicious), "
1618 Asian Fusion,"The soup dumplings here are meaty, soupy, hot and amazing! My bf got the General Tso's which was really good and cute too, I hate places that only give you slices of bread. Happy hour pork chaat and vermicelli taste just like home for $8. However, the tom yum soup was full of hard to swallow large chunks of ginger. It did not come at the time of my BFS admission. It actually came out 15 minutes later. And after entering, I lost my appetite. I will be back for their pad thai! I was going to get the pineapple fried rice but $20","for 3 pieces of chicken is kinda steep. Overall service was okay. Keep in mind this place is very trendy so expect long lines and high prices. Good quality food though. I would go again but for different items.""

1618 Asian Fusion,"This was my second time eating at 1618. Had nothing but wonderful things to say about the food the first time around. That's why we stopped by again. This time the food was good but not great.
We started with the crispy duck skin and five flavor sampler which was great as we got to try all of their specialty. The pineapple fried rice was unique, flavorful, and was served in a pineapple. The rib pho was simply amazing. The dry hieu Thieu was very authentic in terms of taste. Everything about our meal was great except for our drink. We ordered 3 Thai teas and was served spoiled/sour milk. We brought it up to our server who at first questioned us but later went to check as another party made the same complaint. When she did go to check it was  confirmed that the milk was spoiled. The drinking of the Thai tea brought upon diarrhea for 2 of our party members.","Food - Crispy duck skin (great), Five flavor sampler (great), Pineapple fried rice (unique, flavorful), Rib pho (amazing), Dry hieu Thieu (authentic), Thai tea (spoiled/sour)||Service - Confirmed that milk was spoiled, did not offer substitute||Drinks - Thai tea (spoiled/sour)||Ambiance - Great||Menu - Huge "
1618 Asian Fusion,"I was expecting full-on nonstop BBQ marathon when in Austin, so I was surprised when my friend brought me to this fusion place...

Apparently it's ranked highly on some best restaurants list, so naturally my culinary curiosity kicks in!

Quite enjoyed the whole experience here!

The indoor ambiance looks modern and cheerful. We sat outside since the weather was nice.

The menu is massive and pretty much covered all the Asian dishes- with a more focus on southeast Asian dishes. We got a huge spread of items, and everything was good.

As a New Yorker, I was impressed by the Texan portion size - everything really is bigger in Texas. One entree here can feed a family in NYC lol","

1618 Asian Fusion,Ordered the sampler for an appetizer and it was delicious- the egg rolls were our favorite but spring rolls were fresh and came in a close 2nd. Husband got the lamb and I got the vermicelli (both pictured) and they were amazing. Portions were generous. Drinks were also yummy- he got an old fashion and I got a gin drink the waitress recommended that was perfect- not too sweet.

1618 Asian Fusion,"One of my favorite restaurants in Austin. Food is delicious. Live music can get a little loud.

Must try: The pork soup dumplings and chicken pad Thai are the best I've ever had.

Order with caution: The pineapple fried rice, chicken red curry and filet mignon green curry are good but really spicy. I'd recommend pairing these with the coconut fried rice to temper the spice.

Drinks: Loved the lycheeni. The Tokyo ramune is good but might be overly sweet for some. I wouldn't order the dragon mule again.","Food - Pork Soup Dumplings (must try), Chicken Pad Thai (best), Pineapple Fried Rice (good but really spicy, recommended with Coconut Fried Rice to temper spice), Filet Mignon Green Curry (good but really spicy, recommended with Coconut Fried Rice to temper spice), LycheeNI (loved), Tokyo Ramune (good but too sweet)||Music - Live||Service - Friendly and attentive "

1618 Asian Fusion,Beautiful vibe! The food was delicious and service was great. Definitely make a reservation ahead of time as the wait was an hour long on a weekday evening. Parking isn't an issue as there is free garage parking. We were told by the host that the restaurant is recognized as the 8th best in America by Yelp so that was pretty cool! I just wish the restaurant had more vegetarian and vegan options and labeled it better in the menu. The veggie section in the menu is misleading as the tofu curries in that section still use fish sauce.,"Food - Egg rolls (nice fry), Shrimp Panang Curry (started great but got sweeter, needed some acid to balance sweetness), Vegetable curry (started great but got sweeter, needed some acid to balance sweetness)||Menu - Huge||Location - Austin||Parking - Free||Service - Great||Recognition - Recognized as the 8th best in America by Yelp "
1618 Asian Fusion,"From the moment you walk in, you notice the awesome ambience of this place. The night I was there, a live band was playing jazz covers at the front. We didn't have reservations, but we didn't have to wait too long for a table (it was busier than I expected on a Thursday night.) I'd recommend booking a table in advance just to be safe. They have a pretty decent vegetarian menu, and I went with the vegan pho. The bowl was massive and delicious. My only regret is that I didn't try the flambÃ©d cheesecake that comes with some fire and theatrics.

1618 Asian Fusion,"This restaurant is beautiful and artistically decorated. The lights and curved wood on the ceiling are eye-catching.
I definitely recommend getting a reservation if you want to go at a prime time. We waited over an hour for a table, but the wait went quickly since we were able to enjoy delicious drinks from the bar while we waited. The Lycheeni and Lavender d'Blanc were our favorites.
Once we were seated, we ordered 2 appetizers to share. I love that this restaurant has lots of gluten free options, especially items you wouldn't expect, like orange chicken. The salt and pepper calamari appetizer was not only gluten free, but the best calamari I have ever eaten. The pieces were crunchy on the outside and tender within. The sauce served with it was amazing. It was salty and acidic with a flavor my friend nor I could put our finger on. When we asked the waitress, she said it was the chef's secret recipe. The grilled lemongrass duck skewer appetizer was an interesting presentation with the duck pieces wrapped around a lemongrass stalk. The duck itself had more the texture of pressed meat and was rather disappointing.
We were very excited with the presentation of our entrees. I had the Thai Tum Yum Fresh Coconut Fried Rice, crap and shrimp pineapple fried rice, served in a fresh coconut with fresh pineapple around it and garnished with an orchid bloom. It was full of flavors and various textures. The shrimp were large and tender, and the crab meat was easy to find and delicious. There was a little heat to the dish, but not so much as to make it unpleasant for someone like myself with a moderate spice tolerance. My friend enjoyed the Saigon Grilled Lamb Rack with the Saigon pepper lemongrass sauce. She said the lamb was tender and juicy, and that the sauce was amazing. It was also very spicy, and she has a high spice tolerance.
We had a wonderful evening and will definitely be back again to this amazing establishment.","Food - Salt and pepper calamari (best calamari, crunchy outside, tender within), Grilled lemongrass duck skewer (interesting presentation, disappointing duck, lacked flavor), Thai Tum Yum Fresh Coconut Fried Rice (flavorful, various textures, large and tender shrimp, delicious crab meat), Saigon Grilled Lamb Rack (tender juicy lamb, amazing sauce, very spicy)||Ambiance - Beautiful, Eye-catching decor||Service - Friendly, attentive||Drinks - Lycheeni and Lavender d'Blanc (favorites), and the cool looking drinks||Menu - Huge "

And the local we sat next too was not wrong: nothing he's ever gotten here has ever been bad.

1618 Asian Fusion,Do not expect anything to be authentic because all the food is truly fusion. I ordered the Hu Tieu Mi Kho and it was not like the ones I've had at Vietnamese restaurants. I wanted to love it but it was just disappointing. I knew it wouldn't be authentic but the flavors just didn't mesh well. The sauce was very sweet and the pork was heavily peppered.

1618 Asian Fusion,"Modern Asian fusion restaurant serving delicious Vietnamese, Thai, Chinese, Singaporean and Southeast Asian food.

.: Food (5/5 Stars): Large selection of apps, dim sum, pho, hu tieu, and entrees. I would definitely recommend the Five Sampler appetizer that came with egg & spring rolls, wontons, satays, and pork belly buns. The Thai Pineapple Fried Rice entrÃ©e was also amazing (served in a pineapple). Both dishes were pretty spicy (a bit too spicy for my spice tolerance), but super authentic and flavorful. We also enjoyed the Filet Mignon Pepper Steak. They have specials on a few of their dishes during their happy hour (Mon, Tues, & Thurs from 4:30-6pm).

.: Drink (4/5 Stars): Cocktails, sake, beer, & wine. The signature cocktails, sake, and house wine are all $8 during their happy hour + some discounts on beer. We enjoyed some wine and hot sake with our dinner.

.: Service (5/5): SUCH friendly (and fast!) service. Our server was new but was super attentive and accommodating. I asked if they could bring out a desert with a candle to celebrate a birthday and they came out with a very cute personalized ""happy birthday"" cake dish. I would definitely recommend making a reservation in advance if you don't want to wait for a table.

1618 Asian Fusion,"I have been dying to try this place for a very long time. My wife and I literally frequented a pho place very near by but the day I saw the Pho Ribs featured on Instagram, I knew this restaurant would be in my future.

This not only had great flavors but the small things like sliced radish and a hearty deep green lettuce gave it a great texture too. My wife had the chicken pad Thai and she was so happy with it. I jad the pho ribs. They serve the hot broth table side and it was the best pho I have ever had. I almost feel badly that my wife and I will probably never go back to our regular pho place now.

I usually use a lot of lime juice and hoisin sauce, but the broth alone spoke volumes in flavor. The xiao long bao was amazing. The calamari was served with an acidic sauce, and was absolutely sublime. The scallion pancake was layered with warm and chewy interior and a crispy fried exterior.

Loved the sleek and chic interior of the restaurant. We were seated right in front of the stage, which was an unexpected and pleasant surprise!

The performer (The 4 Vesta) was so good! A delightful addition to the dinner we had. 5/5 performance

Since neither of us were that hungry, we decided to order the Thai Tom Yum Fresh Coconut Fried Rice. The dish was overall pretty good, but I felt like it lacked additional flavor. I didn't really taste the coconut in the dish. The crabmeat was pretty scarce. 3/5

The drinks were delicious though (5/5)! Great recommendations from Chow.","Food - Thai Tom Yum Fresh Coconut Fried Rice||Ambiance - Sleek and chic||Service - Attentive, great recommendations "

1618 Asian Fusion,"This review is tough to make. Partially because I'm from the bay area where asian food operates at a high bar, and partially because I had a few drinks. Anyways, we had a large group and got things family style. So here are the cliff notes:

Pad thai - slightly sour
Smoky Old fashioned - cool show but regular old fashioned.
Pineapple fried rice - great and nice spice
Dim sum - okay but I've recently had din tai fung. I tried to be unbiased for that.
Pecking duck - well executed, wish we had more buns to share. The meat to bun ratio felt off.
Fried fish - fantastically seasoned, crispy, a tad dry. Pretty difficult with square sheets to roll.

The hosts were wonderfully accommodating and helpful. A great spot for asian food in texas.","Food - Pad Thai (slightly sour), Smoky Old Fashioned (cool show but regular old fashioned), Pineapple fried rice (great and nice spice), Dim Sum (okay), Pecking duck (well-executed, wish for more buns to share), Fried fish (fantastically seasoned, crispy, tad dry)||Service - Wonderfully accommodating and helpful||Location - great||Ambiance - nice "

1618 Asian Fusion,"While in the area one evening and having a yearning for Pho, we saw this restaurant on social media and were amazed at such amazing reviews, especially for a pan-Asian joint, so we decide to give them a try.  We got there just in time, because there was no wait, but by the time we were leaving, there was a huge line waiting for seating.

Our server, Chou was friendly and helpful.  I told him I was concerned about an Asian restaurant serving Vietnamese, Chinese, and Thai, but he explained they do each very well.  So, we opted for Tom Yum, Pho and Dim Sum (beef dumplings)... something from each style they serve.

Tom Yum - This had a nice flavor, decent fish sauce taste, but was a little on the dark (in color) side.  There was also a big chunk of chicken I got in my mouth loaded with skin/fat, which was rather gross.

Pho - Though the texture of the noodles seemed legit, the broth was dark from what appeared was an abundance of soy sauce that was added to it.  I don't recall ever seeing nor having soy sauce in my Pho in the past.  

Beef Dumplings - At Chou's suggestion, I ordered them pan-fried.  They were really good!  Lots of great ginger flavor in the beef inside the dumpling.  They seem to fry them up in a pan with some sort of egg white mixture that adds an interesting crispy ""web"" to them, making the presentation really nice.

My assessment is they're definitely not authentic, but the flavors are decent.  The dÃ©cor is nice and service is fast and pleasant as well.  Prices are very reasonable, especially for the beautiful venue.  And they have a nice, large wine list too.  As for me, I prefer to go to a specific restaurant for Pho or Chinese or Thai or Sushi or Ramen... These are not typically interchangeable restaurants.","Food - Tom Yum (nice flavor, dark broth, chunk of chicken with excess fat), Pho (dark broth, excess soy sauce), Beef Dumplings (good, interesting ginger flavor, crispy web), "

1618 Asian Fusion,"We came here yesterday on a Sunday night double date to try something new since we are finally coming out more.  This restaurant is located on the bottom of an apartment complex right off riverside close to the boardwalk and parking is either in the garage or spaces that say retail. It was a busy sunday when we arrived and there was a line forming at the hostess stand, we entered from the garage side but there is also a entry on the other side of the restaurant near the patio. Once we entered the decor set the stage that this was definitely asian fusion as the restaurant name describes. It's pretty extravagant and super modern in the design.

Once we were seated the server showed up about 10-15 mins after we sat down, I believe they were also in a transitionary period since later in the evening our server changed. The service was great but maybe we didn't order the right things because I felt as if the food was more of a 3.5 scale and the live pianist was pretty loud on stage that I felt as if the intimacy of the dinner was ruined by the loud music playing for most of the dinner.

We ordered the grilled octopus to start off with as well as the 1618 egg rolls, and 2 orders of soup dumplings. Everything had a good flavor but nothing that wasn't as amazing as everyone else has been describing. I'm also comparing some of these items to other asian restaurants so this might be an unfair assessment. For entrees we shared the Salt n Pepper Shrimp and the Pineapple fried rice. I think i'd come back and maybe try some different dishes but maybe sit further from the stage and do some more unique dishes like the whole fish or duck curry to understand the full flavor profile of this place.","Food - Grilled Octopus (good flavor), 1618 egg rolls (good flavor), Soup Dumplings(good flavor), Salt n Pepper Shrimp (good), Pineapple fried rice (good)||Ambiance - Extravagant, Modern design||Service - Great||Music - Live pianist||Parking - Available "

1618 Asian Fusion,"I had an awesome experience at this spot. Great service, good food & live music. The person playing the piano needs to teach me how to play, he was amazing. This place was extremely packed so my suggestion is to make a reservation or go on a weekday. Here's what I've ordered.

* Thai tea- one of the better Thai teas I've had, it had a good amount of sweetness to it but not overpowering. 4.5/5

* grilled octopus- unique texture but definitely wasn't my favorite. What I can say is that it had a nice charred to it. 2.8/5

* Tom Yum soup- very good, great balance of sour/spice. I will say that if you're not a fan of spicy or aren't use to spice, then don't order it. Unfortunately they cannot adjust the spice level. 4/5

* 1618 egg rolls- even though it looks small & simple, taste wise it was fantastic. It was flaky & had a light crispness on the outside. I also liked that it wasn't greasy at all. The filling on the inside was spot on. I can tell these were made in-house. 4.5/5

* Banana leaf spicy steam salmon- DELICIOUS DELICIOUS DELICIOUS. The fish was cooked to perfection. It was pink & glistening on the inside. My issue with restaurants is that they overcook their fish but this spot delivered it because it was moist. There was a lot of flavors going on in this dish, I tasted coconut, bell peppers, kaffir leaves, curry. It was a great balance of creamy/sweet/zesty. 4.7/5

Overall, it was a great experience from the service to the food. My only issue is with the parking. This restaurant is located on the first floor of an apartment. During busy times you'll be driving around trying to find a spot. They do have garage parking but whoever designed the lines needs to redo it again. They make it so narrow & I feel sorry for folks that drive a truck; you'll literally have to squeeze in that spot & hoping when you open your door that you don't ding someone's car.","Food - Thai Tea (good, sweet), Grilled Octopus (unique, not favorites), Tom Yum Soup (very good, balanced spice), 1618 Egg Rolls (fantastic, light, crispy), Banana Leaf Spicy Steam Salmon (DELICIOUS, perfectly cooked, flavorful)||Parking - Narrow spots, difficult to navigate||Service - Great||Music - Live music||Ambiance - Great "
1618 Asian Fusion,"I have been to this place twice already for a girls night. The original plan is always to go have dinner have couple of drinks and leave.

1618 Asian Fusion,"Kept getting advertisements on yelp for this place, so decided to give it a try.

We had made a reservation, but the wait ended up being so long and took extra time. We went earlier in the day around lunch time on weekend.

What stood out about the food was the presentation of it. We let the staff know our dietary restrictions beforehand and so glad we did because so many things have fish sauce / other meats in it.Thankful that our server was able to help us order correctly, since some members in our group were veg.

Ordered:
-dragonfruit mule: it was okay wouldn't order again as it was ice heavy and not an overall great drink
-thai oat milk matcha tea: pretty good and a cool presentation twist to a classic matcha, but leaves a weird after taste
-thai iced tea: really good in flavor
-tofu eggrolls: typical egg roll taste
-veggie dumplings: colorful dumplings, nicely presented
-tom kha ghai soup: it wasn't bad, could've used more flavor
-pineapple rice: nicely presented, ok in flavor
-veggie pho: vegetable heavy, decent broth flavor
-orange chicken n rice: decent but sometimes those mall/fast food ones hit better

The ambiance and visuals of this place were great, the food was okay in our experience. The staff was kind and helpful which was much appreciated given the preferences in our party. I think it was more of a one-time try for us, but would recommend for anyone looking for a wide array of asian dishes, nicely presented dishes, and a good ambiance.","Food - Dragonfruit Mule (Okay), Thai Oat Milk Matcha Tea (Pretty Good, Cool Presentation, Weird Aftertaste), Thai Iced Tea (Really Good), Tofu Eggrolls (Typical), Veggie Dumplings (Colorful, Nicely Presented), Tom Kha Ghai Soup (Not Bad, Could Use More Flavor), Pineapple Rice (Nicely Presented, Okay in Flavor), Veggie Pho (Vegetable Heavy, Decent Broth Flavor), Orange Chicken N Rice (Decent, Sometimes Mall/Fast Food Ones Hit Better)||Ambiance - Great||Service - Kind and Helpful||Menu - Wide Array of Asian Dishes, Nicely Presented||Price - high "
1618 Asian Fusion,"(3.5/5) Remember this is Asian Fusion!! (It's even in the name!!) So don't expect really authentic asian food, but instead a nice tasty twist! You can park in the parking garage right next door or I believe if you get lucky there are some outdoor parking spots but those are pretty limited! The restaurant itself is spacious and modern, nice decor and there's also outdoor seating! Food was overall pretty tasty (definitely on the more flavorful/salty side), but our waitress didn't bring us any serving spoons for any of our dishes (including the fried rice!!). Regardless, this place is definitely worth trying - I recommend coming in a group of 4 so you can try several dishes!

What we ordered:

[Recommended]
- Calamari Salted Pepper: delicious! Just the right amount of flavoring & crunch! Highly recommend!
- Combo Fried Rice (chicken, beef, shrimp, yellow onion, corn, green onion, egg): delicious fried rice!
- Thai Crispy Redsnapper in Tamarind (batter fresh whole red snapper in spicy Thai tamarind sauce with basil, red bell pepper, yellow onion, lemongrass): they only had the larger size available so we went with that for 4 people and it was a LARGE fish! But the sauce was SOOO tasty! Goes great with rice! Highly recommend!

[Others]
- Whole Peking Duck (whole boneless roast duck served with buns, Peking sauce, green onions, scallions): the Peking sauce is pretty far off from the authentic Peking duck sauce, and it was a little weird getting 4 duck legs? (Haha) I love duck so it the duck meat was still delicious but I almost wished they had the sauce right and served thin wraps instead.
- Grill Octupus (marinated baby octopus charcoal grilled): VERY SALTY! Try at your own risk!

Overall it wasn't a bad experience! I recall the owner stopped by to say hi too. We ended up taking some food home since the fish was HUGE! I would recommend this place if you're looking for an Asian fusion restaurant to dine at!","Food - Calamari Salted Pepper (delicious), Combo Fried Rice (delicious), Thai Crispy Redsnapper in Tamarind (tasty), Whole Peking Duck (delicious duck meat, strange to have four duck legs), Grill Octopus (very salty), Baby Octopus (salmon)||Parking - Available||Service - Great||Ambiance - Modern and spacious||Menu - Huge "
1618 Asian Fusion,"Some of the BEST food in Austin. I am so glad we finally made it out to check out 1618. Our hostess was so nice, the server was so helpful too. We were able to get a reservation for happy hour and tasted a few plates and cocktails off the HH menu!

I think overall our favorite dishes were the green curry and crispy pad Thai.

The flavors were amazing! The pepper sauce with the crispy salmon was SO GOOD.

I can honestly say I loved it all.

1618 Asian Fusion,"Went to 1618 Asian Fusion when in Austin and overall enjoyed the experience minus how slow the service was. We went on a Sunday night and they had live music which was really nice, once seated we got some drinks and food. We ended up ordering the following:

*lycheteeni: this was a lychee martini kind of drink, and if you like the flavor of lychee you will love this, the drink is strong and flavorful all at once!

*pineapple fried rice: this came with duck meat and shrimp and was really flavorful and came in a cute pineapple which was pretty cute

*vegetarian dumplings - they came in different colors and the filling was super flavorful. The chili oil sauce was absolutely delicious

*mango with sticky rice - this was yummy but I felt could have come with more mango - the portion was very less

1618 Asian Fusion,"Man I wish I looked at interior pics and dressed up a little when I went here! So many people were in dates and it's such a nice place with amazing food! A little upscale and pricy but so well worth it. My fiancÃ© and I came around 7:30 and were able to find parking outside plus there's a garage for free retail parking.
There was a little bit of wait as they were packed. After 20 mins or so of waiting we were seated at the bar. There were a few tables that needed to be cleaned up and they probably had reservations. We took what was first available inside. It took a while to place drinks and food in as they were slammed. I ordered the yellow curry with chicken and it was divine! Beautifully presented and the taste was great. Spicy but carefully balanced with some sweetness. It came with a side of rice. I do wish the side rice was a little bigger in portion so I could eat with leftovers.

All in all this is a great date night or night out spot!  Try to get reservations to avoid the wait. But staff was pretty friendly and nice to us.",Food - Yellow Curry with Chicken||Drinks - Place||Location - Upscale||Parking - Free||Service - Friendly and nice

The broth of the pho was so flavorful, I will definitely get that next time. Such a posh environment. The table next to us got the cheesecake flambÃ©, the waiters make it such a fun experience.

1618 Asian Fusion,"This was my 3rd time going to 1618 Asian Fusion, so it's safe to say that I like it.

First thing, I love the place - the restaurant is bright, modern, with great lighting very cool ambiance, and it's big, lots of tables. They also have an outdoor. You can park for free in the huge retail parking garage - 10/10 on look & parking.
We were told the wait would be ~30 minutes on a Wednesday night, and really we waited a little under 10 minutes.

The food is great! We shared a bunch of dim sum: the Soup dumplings ($11) Chicken dumplings ($11), the Beef potstickers ($11). My favs are always the soup dumplings. 2 waiters also said the calamari were their fav app, so we tried it (I'm not a big calamari person) and I LOVED IT!! The sauce that came with it was so delish!
I wanted some sweet to end and got the NYC style Cheesecake ($9) and omg best cheesecake I've had in a while!!

In the past, I've tried:
- the five samplers: loved the pork belly buns, yum!
- their pho and it was very good, but they have too many other yummy things for me to get it again unless I have a craving
- my husband had the pineapple fried rice, a classic there - watch out it's pretty spicy!!

The drinks are a little pricey, at least for the cocktails, ~$12 but good though. I had the 1618 collins and it's very refreshing.

Pro tip:
- Wednesday night is wine night - they have a selection of bottles 50% off so about $20 for a bottle, that's a DEAL!
- They have Happy Hour Monday, Tuesday, Thursday 4:50-6pm and the cocktails, sake and house wine is $8 + some good deals on food","Food - Soup Dumplings (Loved), Calamari (Loved), Cheesecake (Best)||Ambiance - Bright, Modern, Cool||Parking - Free||Drinks - cocktails pricey||Service - Friendly, Attentive "

1618 Asian Fusion,"The food was delicious and aesthetically pleasing. I went here for a birthday dinner and the service, food, and drinks were very good. I got the crispy pad thai, it tasted good but the texture of it was a little off to me. I usually like certain foods crispy but I think I would prefer the regular pad thai over the crispy here. Besides that, everything else was amazing. My friend also loves the pho here.","Food - Crispy Pad Thai (delicious but texturally odd), Pho (excellent)||Service - Great||Drinks - Good "
1618 Asian Fusion,"I had written a bad review and the GM read and responded as well as they could... we came back and had a much better experience second time around.

1618 Asian Fusion,"Every dish we had was too sweet, the appetizers were cold even the ones that weren't supposed to be. The walls were tiled as to make the sound bounce around the room and on top of that there was a a musician singing and playing the piano which sure didn't need to be amplified but was ... way too much. The food came out sporadically, we ordered three appetizers and they came out 10 minutes apart... it was Mother's Day and they were slammed but still. It wasn't their first Mother's Day. The Musician was good at what she did but way to load as to make any table conversation unpleasant.  The waitress was great it wasn't her fault the grilled meats on skewers were not warm but cold and he dishes came ten to twenty minutes apart.

1618 Asian Fusion,"This is a very beautiful Asian fusion restaurant and the food did not disappoint. The menu items are also not super pricey. I've seen worse for smaller portions at places like Lin's or Wu downtown. We came for an early dinner at 5pm on a Friday night and it was pretty easy to get seated.

FOOD: I ordered the soup dumplings and crispy pd thai. Very good, strong tamarind flavor with the pad thai. They said that we couldn't have a non-spicy version of the crispy pad thai but it turned out to be not very hot. I wasn't in love with it as a crispy noodle, because it was like eating wonton chips with pad thai flavoring. I found myself missing eating it in it's usual texture. I just wanted to try something different but I wouldn't choose it again.

The soup dumplings were perfect! Came out super hot and had a lot of liquid. My gf got the chicken dumplings and they had very thick wrapping. It was surprisingly filling.

My friend got the orange chicken. Our waiter said 1618 has the best orange chicken she's ever had. He seemed to think it was great too.

At the end of our meal, we wanted to finish off with egg buns. However we let our waitress know early on that we'd want it after eating our entrees. She didn't put it in until after we finished eating, and we ended up waiting 20 mins for 2 eggs buns after eating our entrees. It was delicious and exactly what we wanted, but took a while to come out.

I'd definitely consider coming back to this location and trying more dishes. They have peking duck and a lot of big dishes worth splurging more on.","Food - Soup Dumplings (perfect, lots of liquid), Crispy Pad Thai (strong tamarind flavor, not very hot), Chicken Dumplings (filling), Orange Chicken (best), Egg Buns (delicious, took a while to come out)||Ambiance - Beautiful||Service - Friendly, Attentive "
1618 Asian Fusion,"I will say that the food, drinks, and ambiance here is amazing! I recommend making reservations as they do get super busy, but other than the wait we had (an hour) it was most definitely worth it! This is a great date night spot and also a fun place to take friends too. We went on a Friday night and there was live music. As far as food, there is nothing that you can order that isn't tasty! I love each dish we ordered was bursting with flavor and deliciousness.  For the table, definitely order the Five Sampler - this comes with an assortment of beef/chicken skewers, lollipop shrimp, pot stickers, and egg rolls. Also get the full duck to make your own little bun sandwiches. Super yummy! The drinks here are also top notch. My favorite drink here was the matcha espresso martini - the perfect blend of coffee and matcha sweetness. Definitely worth visiting when in Austin. As far as parking, they have a parking garage that is free.","Food - Five Sampler (recommended), Full Duck (recommended), Lunch Special (excellent), Duck Fat Fried Rice (excellent), Pineapple Fried Rice (excellent), Combo Fried Rice (excellent), Scallop Caviar Sui Mai Dumplings (excellent), SautÃƒÂ©ed Baby Bok Choy (good), SautÃƒÂ©ed Water Spinach (good), Shrimp Stuffed Eggplant (good), Vegetable steamed dumplings (good), Sesame Chicken (good), Orange Chicken (good), General Tso's Tofu (good), Honey Akaushi Beef (good)||Drinks - Matcha Espresso Martini (favorite)||Parking - Free||Ambiance - Great||Service - Great "

1618 Asian Fusion,"1618 Asian Fusion USED to be my favorite restaurant to go with my fiancÃ©e. We are from out of town & haven't visited in 3 years & our main food goal was to come to 1618 and needless to say I was so so disappointed. Never returning again.

If you have a shellfish allergy, do yourself a favor and don't even go. Everything has ""shellfish"" even your typical chicken pad Thai or filet mignon. Please explain that to me lol. Very limited options for someone who has a shellfish allergy.

Everything started the moment we arrived. We were sat down and it took 15 minutes before someone came to our table. The server only came because I told the host. After the server came to us he was a nice guy and tried to do this best in accommodating me but the chef wouldn't make any changes for someone like me who has an allergy.

In summary, we had 2 glasses of wine, grilled octopus and baos and ordered our check.

1618 we used to LOVE you but now you have lost us. I'll make sure other friends of mine don't visit you all.","Food - Grilled octopus (good), Bao buns (good)||Service - Nice||Ambiance - Nice "
1618 Asian Fusion,"On our weekend visit to Austin, a local recommended we check out this restaurant. We wished our visit was longer so we can try more of the dishes.

We tried the grilled octopus. For me, the marinade had an odd flavor after taste. My partner didn't taste any unusual spice in the marinade and thought the octopus was good.

The second app was the sugarcane shrimps. I had these elsewhere and like them, which was why I ordered it. Unfortunately, 1618's version were oily and lacked flavor.

The main was the bamboo leaf steamed salmon. The was the highlight. You can taste the kaffer in the peanang sauce.

Service at the bar was good so the overall experience was a 3.5.","Food - Grilled octopus (mara-de had an odd flavor), Sugarcane shrimp (lacked flavor), Bamboo leaf steamed salmon(highlight, Kaffer in the peanang sauce)||Service - Good||Ambiance - Nice "
1618 Asian Fusion,"I've been to 1618 a few times, and it's consistently pretty good. They can get busy at night, so I recommend making reservations beforehand. The interior is really modern, clean, and has aesthetic decor.

On my most recent visit, I ordered the pho filet mignon and the meat was nice and tender. The broth was also very flavorful and rich, so I really liked the dish.

My party also split an order of Xiao Long Bao and combo fried rice. The XLB was okay, but I've had better in Austin and way better elsewhere. We sent back our combo fried rice after a few bites because it was extremely salty. Our waiter was really helpful and offered to have it remade. The new fried rice was a lot less salty and had a nice smoky flavor. Overall, if this food was served in a hole in the wall spot, I would likely give it 3 stars, but the ambiance is really nice and they serve pretty good food.","Food - Pho Filet Mignon (nice and tender, flavorful broth), Xiao Long Bao (okay), Combo Fried Rice (salty, later replaced with less-salty version)||Ambiance - Modern, clean, aesthetic décor||Service - Helpful, friendly, accommodating||Menu - Huge "
1618 Asian Fusion,"I ordered the pad Thai on a busy Friday night. The place was packed when I went to pick it up but that's just Austin.

I feel like the portion is a little small for a $20 noodle dish though I did opt for the shrimp so that adds a few bucks. All in all, the dish was delicious, every flavor was fresh and bright. All in all, very enjoyable to eat. I would probably get an appetizer next time.","Food - Pad Thai (Delicious, Fresh and Bright Flavors), Shrimp (Small Portion)||Location - Packed Restaurant||Price - high "

1618 Asian Fusion,"OMG where do i begin. Came because my friend told me the salt and pepper shrimp was to die for....,, After ordering those, the duck chicirones , the beef rib pho and the shrimp and pork belly fresh rolls i think its safe to call this my favorite place. The best part though was Hanna she was our server and boy did she serve.... Personality, kindness, patience and  humor. Love her!!!Wish I could put her in my pocket.  We asked to speak to the manager to sing her praise and John ( the manager) was awesome too. From door to table, chef to management this place was all around amazing.

Make a reservation weeks in advance!!","Food was amazing!! The oxtail in the oxtail pho was so dam good!!! And the meat was so tender! They pour the broth in front of you and it smells so dam good! Then they give you a bowl with rice and you can help yourself to the meat and the broth.

1618 Asian Fusion,The food was decent. Nothing out of the ordinary. Had a Dim sum to start with. Found the chicken filling a bit dry and not well seasoned. Then ordered the general Tso chicken and Thai Tum yum coconut fried rice. The general Tso chicken was too saucy and the fried rice didn't quite tickle my palate. The presentation was good. Finished off with an Ube panna cota. That was delightful. The best dish out of them all. Probably the only reason other than service to give them a 3 star!,"Food - Dim Sum (dry and not well-seasoned), General Tso Chicken (too saucy), Thai Tum Yum Coconut Fried Rice (didn't tickle palate), Ube Panna Cotta(delightful)||Service - Good||Ambiance - Good "

1618 Asian Fusion,"Driving by, I wouldn't have thought this restaurant would be so busy! It was packed from the moment we got there for happy hour, on a Monday, until we left mid dinner service. They had walk-ins on a waitlist, so I would recommend making a reservation in advance. They had a list of $6 cocktails on happy hour and a small list of bites as well. The HH bites didn't catch my eye, so we ordered from the main menu.

Drinks: We ordered the lychee martini and an old fashioned. They do have a smoked old fashioned with fig bitters that has a fancy presentation, but it runs about $20. We went for a regular old fashioned and it was one of the best I've had in a while. I've had lychee martinis before, but didn't quite care for this one.

Food: We asked if the crab in the coconut fried rice was imitation, and they were honest and said yes, which we appreciated. Instead, we ordered the pineapple fried rice, serve in half a pineapple. It was good, but quite spicy so keep that in mind. The lamb was also tasty and had a unique sauce we both enjoyed. The sampler plate was fun because we rated each item 1-5 based on our personal tastes, and we each rated different items higher. It gave us a chance to see what we might enjoy before ordering our entrees.

Overall, the service was good. My only recommendation would be to train the server on the menu a little more.  Every question we asked him, he had to go find out the answer. Overall, it was a fun experience for a birthday dinner and we surprisingly got a free dessert!","Food - Pineapple Fried Rice (good but spicy), Coconut Fried Rice (good but spicy), Lamb (tasty unique sauce), Sampler Plate (fun, ratings not consistent), Lychee Martini (not good), Old Fashioned (one of the best)||Drinks - Smoked Old Fashioned (fancy presentation, high price), Lychee Martini (not good)||Service - Good, untrained||Ambiance - Packed, busy||Menu - Huge "

1618 Asian Fusion,"Hanoi coffe and cheesecake are great here. One of those things that are worth the calories in my opinion.

The Hanoi coffee has this egg custard + coffee combination I hadn't tried before. The coffee has just the right amount of sweetness in my opinion. I usually drink black coffee so I don't like overly sugary coffees. This has the perfect balance of sweet and bold.

Cheesecake is such a selling point for this place. The cheesecake is more Japanese style so it's very fluffy and airy. It's also huge!! Honestly worth it to just come for an afternoon coffee and dessert.

I'll have to come back and add a picture. I will be back just for those two things on the menu. ^^^","Food - Hanoi Coffee (excellent, worth the calories), Cheesecake (huge, worth trying)||Ambiance - Cozy and inviting||Service - Friendly and attentive "

They have a few great items including chinese sausage sticky rice in a claypot with shiitake mushroom, as well as the banh trang. The green thai iced tea also goes really well with everything.

1618 Asian Fusion,"Was in town and looking for a place to eat and found this place.   Was very happy and would return, this was an excellent restaurant.   The day we went it was busy and I think that may be the norm.

Menus has a nice variety, really enjoyed the variety of the 5 item appetizer sampler.

Also, happy with the response on peanut allergy request.    The waitress took note and told us the chefs would be changing gloves when preparing our meals as a normal procedure for them.

Overall would find an excuse to return as we don't live in Austin.   Highly recommend if you are considering trying this restaurant.","Food - Appetizer Sampler(enjoyed), Peanut Allergy Request (note taken, chefs will change gloves)||Service - Helpful||Ambiance - Nice "
1618 Asian Fusion,"Ambience was nice on the inside. Location is not the best and parking was a bit challenging. Server was very friendly and attentive.

1618 Asian Fusion,"On our group's last night of the trip, the Bachelor was dying to try out 1618 and we couldn't have asked for a better experience to end our Texas trip! In the restaurant, I saw that they were featured in the Yelp's Top 100 place to Eat in 2021, and naturally it made me more excited for the meal. Let's just say, it lived up to hype!

We arrived on a Saturday night, and it was busy! They quoted us 45-minutes, and they took our number down and luckily the table was ready in under 10. Great start. Looking at the menu they have a wide variety of dishes from different asian cultures. For starters we went with the XLBs which were delicious. We also went with the Peking Duck, which was alright, not sure if I'd spend $45 on it again, but it's what the bachelor guy wanted. Food presentation is something you can tell they put a lot of thought into.

For my main, I decided to go with the 'Pho Rib'. When they say everything is bigger in a Texas, it's true. You should've seen the size of these tasty beer ribs, they low key looked pre-historic. The meat was tender and fell off the bone. Pair that with homemade fresh noodles, it was worth the $19. The also give you a side of an egg with some broth, I dunno what that was, but it was one of the best things i've ever tasted. Perfectly salty, rich and depth flavor, it was perfect for a cold winter night.

As for the service, it really added to the entire experience. Our server Cassie, was professional, kind, and great to chat with. The restaurant is beautifully designed, and the theatrics that come along with some of their cocktails and desserts add to the overall vibe of the place. We even got a free-style rap by another server before we took off. Great night all around!

If you are in the area or visiting and/or craving Asian food, this spot is worth checking out. Great for a nice dinner date or night out with a group of friends. Reservations are recommended since it is pretty popular.","Food - XLB (delicious), Peking Duck (alright), Pho Rib (tender, falling-off-the-bone meat, homemade noodles), Egg (perfectly salty, rich, depth flavor)||Service - Professional, kind||Ambiance - Beautifully designed||Performance - Free-style rap "

They don't say this on the menu, but you can get a flavor burst added to your cocktails and I highly suggest you do just for the experience!

1618 Asian Fusion,"I came here on a Sunday for an early dinner. There was still a 30 min wait which I didn't mind because this restaurant is conveniently near a boardwalk/trail. I recommend walking the trail if you don't want to wait in your car or the restaurant.

Food was delicious! I started off with their appetizer sampler. It consisted of 5 different items and tasted really good. I like that they came with a variety of sauces to complement each of the different items. The menu labelled it as Spicy, but it is not spicy at all so don't let that deter you if you can't tolerate spice. It's a great appetizer to get if you want to try a little of everything.

I also had their crispy pad thai and the whole Peking duck. The crispy pad thai was very yummy and unique. I will caution, it is very saucy.  IMO, it is more of an entree to share and probably would've been good paired with a nice bowl of white rice to balance all that sauce. Regardless, very yummy and interesting take on the classic chicken pad thai! Their Peking duck was also on another level. The skin was crispy and meat cooked very well. It was delicious and couldn't have asked for a better dinner.

I definitely would like to come back to try their other dishes on the menu!","Food - Appetizer Sampler (variety, tastes great, no spice), Crispy Pad Thai (yummy, very saucy), Peking Duck (crispy skin, cooked well)||Location - Near a boardwalk/trail||Ambiance - Convenient||Service - Friendly, attentive||Wait Time - 30 minutes "
1618 Asian Fusion,"1618 is an absolute gem in Austin.  Its a bit difficult to go to without a reservation, but pickup is always an option quick to pickup.

1618 Asian Fusion,"4.5 stars if I could. For ATX this is a pretty solid Asian spot. We started off with the smoked old fashion and the lemongrass tangerine refresher. The old fashion ice cube had a 1618 imprint and was smoked table side which was very theatrical.

We though the crispy pad Thai was very innovative as we have never seen this style of pad Thai before. The green curry was a strong standard curry with enough kick and a creamy finish. The filet mignon with onion was a bit on the salty side but the caramelized onion's' sweetness compensated for it. We finished off with another two table side shows, the vanilla and limoncello imported from Italy with the smoke flavor enhancing bubbles; and of course the flambÃ© cheesecake with a vanilla liquor ignited tabled side and pored over the cheesecake whilst cinnamon power was sprinkled on top creating a very flashy show.

The staff was superb and enthusiastic.

I ended up getting the Lavender drink she recommended and my friend got an islander drink of the HH menu. They were DELICIOUS. The beef dumplings were cooked to perfection. The Pad Thai was flavorful and I ended up subbing the chicken for shrimp and shrimp was cooked perfectly. My friend got the Orange chicken and it was definitely delicious as well. We topped the night off with a yummy creme brÃ»lÃ©e.

We were mostly shocked by the speed of the service. Everything came out incredibly quick. All in all, it's a fantastic place if you're into Happy hour. Will definitely be going back.

1618 Asian Fusion,"If you didn't know, 1618 Asian Fusion was ranked #8 on Yelp's Top 100 Places to Eat of 2021 (blog.yelp.com/news/yelp-â€¦). Because of this we had to stop by here to see what the buzz was all about. The restaurant is located near downtown Austin just south of Lady Bird Lake.

We made a reservation on Yelp a couple days before and I'm glad we did because when we were there I overheard that a table for 2 at 8:30pm on a Sunday night was going to be about an hour wait. It's a large restaurant with a lot of tables as well as a bar area which is where I ordered my drink while we were waiting for our table to be ready. We sat down and were surprised to see that the music that we had been listening to was actually live music!

My first drink was the lycheeni ($11) which had good lychee flavor and was slightly tart. My second drink was the blue smash ($12) which was very refreshing from the blueberry and the mint.

THAI PINEAPPLE FRIED RICE ($18) - This fried rice didn't blow me out of the water but it was still good. It comes with duck as the protein and is served in a half pineapple which is always a good deal and nice presentation. 3.5/5

CRISPY PAD THAI ($17) - This is definitely something I haven't seen at other Thai restaurants so it intrigued me. The only difference is that the noodles are fried before being tossed in the sauce. The texture is interesting since the sauce makes the crispy noodles slightly less so. I thought it was good and worth a try but I think next time I'd stick to the normal pad thai noodles. 4/5

FILET MIGNON STIR FRY ONION ($17) - This is another thing that I don't see often at Thai restaurants and surprisingly this was my favorite dish. We ordered the meat cooked medium rare and they gave it to us closer to medium well but it was still so tender it didn't really matter. The sauce was honestly so good I was slathering it on white rice and eating it just like that. 5/5

FLAMBEAU EVEREST CHEESECAKE ($16) - The cheesecake tasted slightly bitter from the alcohol of the licor 43 but it was sweet and tart. Let's be honest though: if you're ordering this you're most likely doing it for the flaming presentation. Do it because it's worth. 5/5

The service was superb! Our server walked us through some of their more popular dishes and gave us a recommendation on wine (which was coincidentally the most expensive one. Hmm...). The ambiance was not like that of a typical ""fancy"" restaurant but it had great vibes. The service, the atmosphere, and the live music certainly took my experience to the next level. I think it's worth the reputation of being #8 on the list because I had a wonderful experience.","Food - Thai Pineapple Fried Rice (good but not blown away), Crispy Pad Thai (interesting concept, good taste), Filet Mignon Stir Fry Onion (favorite), Flambeau Everest Cheesecake (bitter from alcohol in Licor 43, sweet and tart)||Service - Superb||Ambiance - Great vibes||Live music||Recommendation on wine (most expensive)||Price - high "

1618 Asian Fusion,"Wow..... Just wow... I thought I was walking into some mom and pop restaurant until I was walking up to the door to find out if this was serving a couple of apartment/condominium.  Please try this place at least once, this is where do you want to take a casual date.
Parking is challenging depending on what time you get here because you will be finding yourself in a tight parking place where you might as well be almost touching you neighbors mirrors.  This place might be hard to find because it is not right on the street but instead you need to go back to what are some apartment/ condominium building looking somethings and then you will find it..

I came here for the beef rib$20 Pho and it does not disappoint.  You at a table side view of them pouring your broth into a bowl in front of you.  There is a satellite bowl where they pour as well, that is where your egg yolk is.   I did not know if I needed to properly use utensils for just pick up my rib barbaric style but it looks like half of the people pick it up from the ends and some use utensils.  The meat is so tender where you could literally use chopsticks to pull the meat off.  Really good flavor but no intruding over tones of cinnamon and dust anise, I guess the broth is ""fused"" :with something else, worth the $20.

You won't find nothing but commanding professionalism from the Young workers here, worthy of working in 5 star Hotels I would say.

Very nice ambient atmosphere for a comfortable meal or even a date.  I recommend!

They have happy hour until 7pm which includes $3 draft beer and $5 appetizers.

A very good experience I had and will definitely be back.","Food - Beef Rib Pho (worth the price), Satellite bowl with egg yolk (adds a nice touch), Tender beef, Professional service||Location - Not easily accessible||Parking - Challenging||Ambiance - Nice "
1618 Asian Fusion,"Honestly, everything about this restaurant is perfect. A few things to know before going probably book a reservation they're always super busy and wait could be longer than an hour. The food is always made to perfection. There was one time or maybe two times that my food did not come out on time when I ordered it even though the waiter took me and my friend order at the same time mine came out 20 minutes later. But besides that I atmosphere is always really good I know on the weekend they have live music.
Ps they have a award winning pho and that cheesecake is to die for must try if it's your first time there

So just be careful do not park in another businesses spot because your car will be towed.",Food - Perfect||Ambiance - Good||Parking - Difficult||Service - Super busy||Music - Live||Menu - Award-winning pho||Cheesecake - Must try 
1618 Asian Fusion,"First and foremost, our waiter did a fantastic job and we had no issues. He was very respectful and was perfectly attentive. Our issues were with the mixed drinks and more importantly the food.

We began the night with a few appetizers. First we had the grilled octopus, which was fairly underwhelming. There was very little flavor at all, resulting in a chewy flavorless experience. The pineapple sauce helped to make up for the lack of flavor but still was fairly disappointing overall.

Our second appetizer was the Five Sampler. I'll break this one down by dish since it involves multiple dishes. First, the 1618 egg rolls were interesting but relatively unsatisfying but were one of the few out of the appetizers that was acceptable. The grilled pork patty skewers were also fair but lacked seasoning and character. The spring roll was disappointing, especially since it was obvious that the ingredients used were not fresh as was evident by the bruised lettuce and flavorless vegetables used. The pork belly bao would have been satisfying if there was more than a mere morsel of meat in them.

The last part of the appetizers deserves a paragraph of its own, which is the sugar cane shrimp. After the first bite, it became very evident that they were only half cooked and were prepared very poorly. We brought this to our waiter's attention, making it clear that we just wanted them to be aware of the issue. What was highly concerning was that he wasn't surprised and made it evident that it's a common issue with that dish. I can understand a mistake once or twice, but shrimp are considered unsafe to be consumed undercooked and the fact that it was a consistent issue and not just an issue with ours specifically made us highly concerned about the rest of our meal.

During this time, we each had a Smoky Old Fashioned, one with Angel's Envy and one with Bulleit Rye. Although I believe the decision to use a stout beer glass was to try to contain the smoke, it changed the taste of the drink so much that it destroyed the old fashioned. These should have been served in a rocks glass to begin with and is a basic bartending rule.

For our main course, one of the dishes we ordered was the chicken pad thai. This was very fresh and was enjoyable, and at your asking price of $17 is definitely worth the cost.

The other dish that was ordered was the imperial crispy red fish but prepared in the style of the snapper. This dish was extremely dissatisfying due to the outrageous cost given the quality received. The red fish had obviously been frozen previously and was suffering from freezer burn, as was evident by the large patches of greying flesh throughout the fish.

We ordered two more drinks to follow up with our main courses, one of which was the watermelon cucumber. This was an enjoyable drink, although it was not a favorite of ours it was a well done cocktail.

The other drink was supposed to be a dry gin martini with a twist. The first concerning thing was that I received a half full martini. This was already dissatisfying, but on top of that the drink was highly sweet and not at all dry. Perhaps the bar made the wrong drink, but regardless it was highly disappointing.

Overall this was an extremely disappointing experience, and I simply cannot recommend 1618 to anyone given the gross negligence that was highly evident throughout the entire night, especially given the absurd price that is asked for. The experience was so poor that I cannot see myself returning to 1618 in the future.

This was also sent to the owner of the establishment, and I made it clear I was not looking for a refund or a chef's table. I did not receive a reply.","Food - Grilled octopus (underwhelming, lacked flavor), Pineapple sauce (helped but was disappointing), Five Sampler (interesting but unsatisfying), 1618 egg rolls (acceptable), Grilled pork patty skewers (fair, lacked seasoning), Spring roll (disappointing, fresh ingredients were not)||Service - Fantastic||Drinks - Smoky Old Fashioned (destroyed by the glass, should have been served in a rocks glass), Watermelon cucumber (enjoyable), Dry gin martini (concerning, was half full, was highly sweet)||Price - Absurd||Menu - Chicken pad thai (fresh, worth the cost), Imperial crispy red fish (extremely dissatisfying, frozen, suffered from freezer burn)||Ambiance -"

"
1618 Asian Fusion,"Honestly, our whole 1618 Asian Fusion experience was just okay.

The only items that we really enjoyed were the...
(1) Thai Pineapple Fried Rice (duck, shrimp, pineapple and veggies.... well balanced and tasty; I liked how finely the veggies were cut in order to create a homogenous mixture, I would definitely recommend this dish above the others).
(2) Grilled Lemon Grass Duck Skewers - which were just fine

We also had the Five Sampler... which was, to be honest disappointing on two fronts... (1) the fact that they were out of several items and (2) the fact that nothing really jumped out as something we would want to order again.

Overall, for a location that looked so fancy and had such a long wait (~1 hour when we arrived at a non-peak time, but granted on the weekend; in hindsight we should have reserved a table)... the experience did not feel fancy. The plates came out wet, and the tables were made of laminate, etc.","Food - Thai Pineapple Fried Rice (enjoyed), Grilled Lemon Grass Duck Skewers (fine), Five Sampler (disappointing)||Ambiance - Not fancy||Service - Disappointing "

1618 Asian Fusion,"Would recommend getting a reservation WAY in advance... This place is popping!

Upscale atmosphere with live music on some nights. The servers are very friendly and knowledgeable. Would recommend: soup dumplings (some of the best in Austin), any of the phos (very popular), the Thai pineapple fried rice (a little spicy, served in a pineapple), and the flaming dessert. The papaya salad was not my favorite, but good nonetheless.

Great spot for a date night or special event! Free parking in the adjacent retail garage.","Food - Soup Dumplings (recommended), Phở (popular), Thai Pineapple Fried Rice (spicy), Flaming Dessert||Ambiance - Upscale||Service - Friendly and knowledgeable||Parking - Free "

1618 Asian Fusion,"Very good, friendly service. I wanted Pho. My server said Pho Rib was her favorite. I gave it a try. WOW. Served with a huge chunk of ribs and filet mignon shaved inside, it's a HEARTY portion. Delicious broth was full of flavor before I added hoisin and sriracha. I'll be back to try a few other dishes.

1618 Asian Fusion,"Arrived here on Christmas Day and while it was packed, we were able to be seated pretty quickly. The service was very good and since it was my first time, they explained their menu and dim sum pretty thoroughly. Overall, the food was amazing! I definitely recommend eating family style, that way you can try a bunch of their items! Highly recommend their duck if you're looking to splurge.

1618 Asian Fusion,"We went on a Thurs night. They had a live band - it was a busy happening place. We ordered food for the table to try a variety: Soup dumplings, white fried fish, fish salmon, molten lava cake, sweet sticky mango rice. Loved every bite! Everything was over the top good EXCEPT the molten lava cake- it was ok, but the filled chocolate bundt cake was not as amazing as we hoped. I'd try a different dessert next time.

1618 Asian Fusion,"1618 has been on my saved places to try list for so long, and on Sunday we were near and decided to final try it! The wait is long which we knew it would be and why we usually avoid this place but we wanted to experience and joined the waitlist via the hostess by giving our phone number, and receiving a text but you can also join the waitlist on Yelp! It's a really cool feature, the text will send you a link to Yelp that shows what place you are in line and went from 25th in line to ready in exactly 37 minutes. While we waited we grabbed drinks at the bar, I got The Emperor it was excellent whiskey and my date got a Tokyo Ramune. When we were seated we started with appetizers first the pork belly spring rolls, Xiao long bao dim sum and Saigon chicken wings. Everything was literally amazing, seasoned well, spicy, dipping sauce, flavor was perfect for every single item. I could literally just eat the apps! Our main course was pineapple fried rice that had excellent duck and mix of veggies, I also got orange chicken it was spicy and my favorite part of main course. My date had white rice with lamb chops they were exquisite cooked perfectly medium and served with a scrumptious lemon dressing and side salad. Hands down best dinner I've had in Austin this far. We had limoncello shots that had a beautiful smoke bubble atop, I had a vsop Dusse with dinner and my date has a dragon mule. Any place that has Dusse and ginger ale my two favorite drinks is 5 stars in my book! There was also live music during most of our dinner that set the mood and elevated the vibe immensely, it was such a lovely addition to an already amazing dinner! We ended dinner with dessert the flambeau Everest and vanilla creme brÃ»lÃ©e. While the flambeau experience was one of a kind, the desserts were good but not great. The creme brÃ»lÃ©e was too stiff and  the Everest was much better. Wonderful place that I cannot wait to try again!

1618 Asian Fusion,"Dim sum was good; The custard baos were delicious, and the soup dumplings were decent.

1618 Asian Fusion,"We saw on yelp that this place had very high ratings from a lot of people. So we thought we'd give it a try. We were NOT disappointed. The friendliness of the staff, beginning with the hostess to the waitress, to the server was amazing. Each one had sweet, caring smiles to make us feel like family. I had the yellow curry and it was outstanding! My wife had the Shrimp, crab meat, fried rice in a coconut shell. It was very tasty. I was lucky she shared a bite with me..
  When you go there, from I-35, you will likely take a left turn just after seeing the sign for it and go around to another left turn. Then you may enter the public parking garage across the street from the entrance to the restaurant. Parking was the only thing that we found difficult. Now you won't have that issue.
   Also, you can make reservations. And you can order for takeout. Give it a try!","Food - Yellow Curry (Outstanding), Shrimp, crab meat, fried rice in a coconut shell (Very tasty)||Service - friendly, sweet, caring smiles||Parking - Difficult||Location - hard to find||Ambiance - Amazing "

When we first walked in it looked like a small place. But as u go a little further, the main dining room opens up to a larger room with such nice decor and a live musician performing.

We were a party of two and got seated at the bar. If you're looking for true Asian fusion food & bomb drinks look no further! You have to try this place!

1618 Asian Fusion,"This was my first time in Austin and let me tell you asian food isn't all that buuut this place.... Definitely worth your stop if you ever visit.

They have a parking structure in the back, outdoor seating for dining on a nice day, and a stage for live music or vendors.

The servers and host were very friendly. The restaurant itself ranked as #8 on yelp, they even had a print out with a frame that's how you know it's top notch haha.

They had a special for mimosa from 9 am - 4 pm. They had different menu specials that varies from dim sum, Thai food to Vietnamese.

Since it is a fusion place it definitely wasn't confusion but the most recommended dishes were the Vietnamese food such as Hu tieu ko (dry noodle soup), raw egg with rib pho, and the Saigon noodles.

They recommended the long bao which is dumping with soup inside of it for dim sum dishes. It was so scrumptious and flavorful...my mouth is watery just writing about it. The egg custard was delicious as well!

There were fresh coconut drinks, ice coffee and tea. The tea came in this very elegant pot with a mug.

My first visit was great, the atmosphere was festive and it was busy! The hostess seated me immediately and my waiter took the time to get to know me and made suggestions to my liking. I tried the appetizer sampler, the egg rolls were my favorite followed by the pork buns, but seriously everything was delicious. As my main dish I tried the green curry Filet Mignon, I'm not a Thai food expert but my taste buds were on fire! It was a great combination of sweet and savory and the steak was tender and juicy.

I came back two days later and they were consistent, from the atmosphere to the service, it's hard not to love this place.

The server we had was helpful in giving us recommendations and asking if we had any food allergies or dietary restrictions. We started with drinks and I had the Tokyo Ramune, then from the Dim Sum menu Sugar Cane Shrimp. Our meals were Salted Pepper Shrimp and Filet Mignon Green Curry.

I really enjoyed the crispy pad Thai with shrimp. A unique take on a classic! Flavorful & crispy is always a recipe for success and 1618 hit it out of the park with this dish.

I also had the lemongrass duck skewers - AMAZING! So juicy, so tender, and so full of flavor. I could eat these all day.

It's super classy and gorgeous inside, so props to them on that. They spent a lot of money and time decorating. There is a cool wood panel that goes up the wall and over the ceiling which is really aesthetically pleasing. Ambiance is great. They had live music when we went on a Saturday.

Service was good. Saki was good.

Really liked the 5 sampler. It came with spring rolls, egg rolls, katsu sliders, wontons and grilled chicken with plenty of sauce. It was large and great for splitting with a big group. Everything was pretty tasty, although something did feel a little lacking about the egg rolls.  

My boyfriend also ordered the chicken wings which were cooked and flavored quite well.

The main dish was just ok. I got the Vietnamese bowl with shrimp. I was disappointed the shrimp still had tails as it's not the kind of dish I really want to do extra work with. They were also stuck to a skewer and it made it hard to get the shrimp off. Just extra work and inconvenient . The bowl was lacking in flavor in my opinion as well.

I did try a bite of my friends pineapple fried rice and it was pretty good.

I would come back if invited but wouldn't go out of my way to go again and would order a different entree.","Food - Sampler Platter (nice assortment), Egg Rolls (lacking), Shrimp Bowl (lacking flavor), Pineapple Fried Rice (pretty good)||Ambiance - Classy and gorgeous||Service - Good||Live music||Menu - Huge "
1618 Asian Fusion,"This is easily my favorite Asian restaurant in Austin right now! Be prepared for a wait any day of the week, but you can easily grab some tasty drinks from the bar while you sit in their modern lobby. I'm usually wary of fusion restaurants, but this place is both respectful and delicious!

It was 100 degrees outside, so I snagged a refreshing muddled blueberry and mint rum drink. This added extra value at the table when I poured my water into the glass for infused water! At the table, I ordered the Thai tea and my friend ordered the Vietnamese iced coffee. Both were heavenly and perfect for the hot day.

I've been dying to try a Vietnamese pizza since seeing it on Best Ever Food Review Show! This one didn't disappoint. Imagine a crispy chewy rice paper sheet with fresh herbs, chicken, and spicy Mayo. I could eat so many. We followed that with the rainbow scallop dumplings. They were pan seared in the bottom and were a highlight of the meal. My only wish was that I had gotten the octopus instead of the squid...

The Pad Thai had everything you'd want from the signature dish of Thailand. It was sweet, crunchy, chewy, savory, and had that ""wok hay"" you crave. Only thing is I wish it was much spicier.

If I'm on this side of town, I'm definitely coming here again!","Food - Thai pizza (delicious), Vietnamese pizza (disappointing), Pad Thai (sweet but lacked spice), Thai tea (heavenly), Vietnamese iced coffee (heavenly)||Drinks - Muddled blueberry and mint rum (refreshing), Thai tea (heavenly)||Ambiance - Modern, inviting||Service - Friendly, attentive "

1618 Asian Fusion,"I LOVED 1618. I got the pho, and it was seriously the best pho I've ever had in my life.

1618 Asian Fusion,"Cute chic place with a back patio that allows dogs. We tried the whole Peking duck that comes with fluffy yummy bao and was delicious. We also had the salt and pepper lobster with was so tasty, specifically the parts that the seasoning touched, though I wished they provided a dipping sauce for the parts that it didn't. The cucumber watermelon cocktails was nice and refreshing, and their Thai iced tea was one point. Fried tofu was also great and had a flavorful dipping sauce. Overall great experience and interesting menu!

Great server too!

1618 Asian Fusion,"BEST accident ever! I just randomly searched up a good place to eat at for a long due date with my girlfriend and did not expect to end up here. We couldn't find a seat so we got bar seats AGAIN. But that aside, the service here was awesome we got greeted when entering the servers seemed a little in a rush but entirely due to how crowded this place was so I totally get it. I opened the menu and I pretty much new what I wanted to try and let me tell you... this Crispy pad Thai was fireee! I loved it so much and we were rlly happy the peanuts were on the side because we like it separated personally so we can add it into our bites. Second up the sampler was perfectly sized for two to try  a few different things, our personal favorite were the spring rolls and the kebabs and the baos were really good too. Overall reliably and way above average food, great looks (if there was an earthquake here there would be so much alcohol on the floor I kid you not) and awesome quick service!","Food - Crispy pad Thai (loved it), Sampler (perfectly sized, favorites were spring rolls and kebabs, Baos were really good)||Ambiance - Great looks||Service - Awesome||Experience - Great "
1618 Asian Fusion,"This place is the MOST DEVINE, AMAZING, FABULOUS & DELISHES place you can go for Asian Fusion food. I can rave about this place for the food, service & atmosphere. I ordered my fave & go to Yellow Chicken Curry. It was smooth, spicy & delishesly prepared. It was the BEST. My husband ordered the Whole Peking Duck. I think I saw a tear of delight in his eye . He kept going on & on after every bite. It was crispy skin on the outside yet juicy & tender on the inside. It was an extraordinary experience in just the food alone. Our server, I think was the busboy, who was very helpful, knowledgeable & friendly, was awesome. Our waiter only came twice to tell us he was very busy & to bring the tab, other than that, cuddos to the busboy. Even then, this place is a MUST.","Food - Yellow Chicken Curry (smooth, spicy, delicious), Whole Peking Duck (crispy skin, juicy & tender)||Service - Helpful, knowledgeable, friendly||Ambiance - Awesome "
1618 Asian Fusion,"After a long and very early morning of delayed flights, we were craving good food upon arrival in Austen - And this hit the spot.

This place was poppin' - attracting a very diverse population - with a wait time of 1hr+ for indoor dining and 30min+ for take-out Christmas, ~4PM. We didn't mind waiting tho, because we killed time at the Colorado River walk directly adjacent to the restaurant as recommended by the nice lady who took our order. She also took down our phone number to let us know when our food would be ready but we never got a call lol.

- Dragon Fruit Rose Refresher $5 - slight hint of Rose and pleasant chunks of dragonfruit. Would get again.
- Lemongrass Tangerine Refresher $5 - Citrus-y and lemongrass undertones. Little too sour for my taste.
- 6-pc Viet Chkn Wings $12 - Basil, bell paper, lemongrass?, fish sauce undertones in the sauce. Chicken wings were thiccc and had a good crisp but nothing special.
- 4-pc Lamb Chops $20 - Bomb. How I'd imagine good lamb to taste and cooked (medium rare, as requested). Basil? Sauce for the mini salad was p good too.
- Crispy Fried Pad Thai $17 - Interesting! Never seen this on a thai menu before. The noodles were bunched up and fried, though the sauce cut back on the crunch. Chicken was tender. Though tasty, I prob will just get the normal pad thai next time.
- 3 skewers x 3 Grilled Octopus $9 - Not too chewy and perfectly cooked with a tangy sauce.

Overall, unique asian thai+viet asian spot that's worth a try! Probably won't come back tho lol - pricey. (Didn't order but $7 for 3 shrimp dumplings is the most I've ever seen lol)","Food - Dragon fruit rose refresher (good), Lemongrass tangerine refresher (too sour), Vietnamese chicken wings (thicc and crispy), Lamb Chops (bomb), Crispy fried pad thai (interesting, noodles bundled up and fried, chicken tender), Grilled octopus (perfectly cooked, tangy sauce)||Price - high "

1618 Asian Fusion,"I was just looking at this restaurant again to take some people there, and I realized that I never reviewed it before, which I should fix! On my first visit, I came straight from hot yoga, so I was a sweaty mess, which was really obvious when I walked into the lovely room. I didn't know where my friends were, so I walked by them twice, but they eventually yelled at me, which was exactly the subtle clue I required. We were a small birthday party, and our server whose name escapes me (beautiful Ukrainian lady who was awesome at her job) treated us like truly valued guests, despite the fact that they were in a bit of a rush to get us out of there before they started a company party. Food was delish and beautifully presented, and I was with people who do food for a living and who have lived in various parts of Asia, so that's a professional and a cultural opinion. I'm planning to come back soon, which says a lot in a town with as many options as Austin. The only weird part was trying to find parking. I passed it at least once. Maybe they could work on signage for people who, like me, need to be told exactly what to do when it comes to parking...or they could designate someone to yell at me, which also works.",Food - Delicious||Service - Awesome||Parking - Difficult||Ambiance - Lovely 
1618 Asian Fusion,"Everything about this place is 5 stars. The ambiance, food, and service are top quality.

The five sampler was perfect for a table of 4.

The salty, pepper shrimp was very tasty. Plump shrimp in a mildly spicy panko covering that was delectable.

If you're looking for somewhere to eat, this is it.

Amazing atmosphere, great staff, and incredible food.
Wait time was super reasonable. Restrooms are clean. Food came out quickly despite just how busy they were.

Five sampler - 10/10 - wontons were my absolute favorite but the pork belly buns gave them some competition.

Xioa Long Bao (pork soup dumplings) - 100/10
Flavor is sooooo good. Came out nice and hot. Filling was great. I'd eat these everyday if I could.

Brisket and filet mignon pho - 10/10
too good to describe.

Flambeau Everest cheesecake - 100/10
Are you kidding me? The little show that goes with it was so neat. The cheesecake is nice and creamy. The pineapple ice cream went perfectly. The toasted sugar was (drool emoji). Make sure you grab this too.

The restaurant is also in such a great spot. Afterwards we walked down to the lake and followed the trail. Perfect afternoon!

Everything is soooo flavorful. Do yourself the favor and eat here!

1618 Asian Fusion,"We thoroughly enjoyed our experience at 1618 Asian Fusion and look forward to returning to try additional menu items. The restaurant has a great ambiance and is tastefully designed. Our dinner featured some BIG hits and a couple of minor misses.

Chicken Pad Thai 10/10  (The best Pad Thai in town)
Filet Green Curry 10/10  (Yummy: creamy and spicy, served with eggplant, mushrooms, and basil)
Soup Dumplings 10/10  (very good)
Orange Chicken (6/10) This was a miss. The chicken wasn't crispy and didn't seem like it was served fresh. The flavor was good.
Banh Trang Da Nang (Viet Pizza) 8/10. This was an interesting appetizer. Lots of flavors.
Sugar Cane Shrimp (7/10) We liked them. Beautiful presentation. Tasted good.
Flaming Cheesecake (10/10)  Gotta say the presentation was fantastic, and the taste was even better. Nice way to cap an excellent meal.

One strange experience... our waitress told us they weren't offering Happy Hour today, explaining that management told them not to offer it because they were short-staffed. I get it, but... okay? The drinks were good and strong, however. Overall, I can see why this place is rated so highly, and I think a 5-Star review is definitely justifiable. There was a slight downgrade to a 4-Star because of the Happy Hour explanation and for the non-crispy orange chicken on this visit.","Food - Chicken Pad Thai (best), Filet Green Curry (yummy: creamy and spicy, served with eggplant, mushrooms, and basil), Soup Dumplings (10/10), Orange Chicken (6/10), Banh Trang Da Nang (interesting, lots of flavors), Sugar Cane Shrimp (good, beautiful presentation), Flaming Cheesecake (great, fantastic presentation)||Ambiance - Great ambiance||Service - Strange explanation for not offering happy hour||Drinks - Good and strong "

1618 Asian Fusion,"This place was popping on a Friday night. I can see why everyone comes here, pretty decor, great ambiance, live music, amazing cocktails, and delicious food.

I started off with the saketini which was strong and refreshing. Then proceeded to a calamari salt and pepper which had an amazing addicting sauce. What intrigued me was the pho rib, presentation was on point. They come out with two bowls and a kettle to pour steaming hot soup into a raw egg bowl and the noodle rib bowl. That beef rib was so generous where they gave two huge pieces. The flavor of the soup was amazing.

This is definitely on my must return spot.","Food - Saketini (strong and refreshing), Calamari salt and pepper (amazing, addicting sauce), Pho rib (generous, amazing flavor), Beef rib (generous, amazing flavor)||Ambiance - Pretty decor||Live music||Drinks - Amazing cocktails||Service - Great "

1618 Asian Fusion,Came in with a friend tonight and want to rate it higher because I love the ambiance and wait staff is so nice and friendly. Pad Thai was mediocre there are better places for pad Thai in austin but maybe I ordered wrong. I would go back but just order a different dish (they have a big menu is a good thing)! The pad Thai was just watery and too many toppings not enough noodles/ chicken (the important part)! But maybe most upsetting my friend and I got the molten lava cake which we were excited about and was told it was pineapple icecream. On a 100+ day that would have definitely been a treat! But the presentation and look of the cake was good but it was definitely vanilla icecream and not pineapple. They could have told us they were out of pineapple or something but for a $14 dessert we should have got what we paid for!

It's one of those places that stockpiles toilet paper and to-go boxes in plain sight. You know the type. For as much as you pay here you shouldn't have to see supplies displayed out in the open.

1618 Asian Fusion,"1618 has really great vibes. The entire place is well-decorated for Christmas, and the hostess was super warm when she welcomed us in. I've heard some great things about 1618, so I'm a little disappointed by the food. That said, it really comes down to personal preference on the dish (more below)!

Food:
There's a lot to choose from, and everything looked amazing on the menu! I ended up getting the Thai Tum Yum Coconut Fried Rice (yes, it comes in a coconut)! which had great flavor. The only problem? It was covered in cilantro, which wasn't previously listed on the menu. As someone who got the soap gene for cilantro, the fried rice was definitely disappointing -- so just a heads up to ask if you can have this dish without if you're like me.

Service:
The service was average -- 1618 was swamped though, so I don't blame the servers for being busy. All in all, they did a good job keeping up with our needs (refilling waters, grabbing menus), which I can appreciate.

TLDR: Atmosphere was great, food was so-so, service was good. I would definitely recommend 1618 to anyone in the Austin area, but be sure to clarify any of your likes/dislikes with the servers. Even if an ingredient isn't listed on the menu, it might be incorporated into the dish anyways!","Food - Thai Tum Yum Coconut Fried Rice (great flavor, disappointing because it was covered in cilantro, which wasn't listed on the menu), Service - Good||Ambiance - Great||Menu - Huge "

i always get a green thai iced tea which goes so well with everything. last time i came, we tried the egg coffee, which was so delish. if you have a sweet tooth, definitely get it!

Beef Pot Stickers - These were hearty and savory deliciousness! We preferred the soup dumplings, if forced to choose between the two, but both were stupid excellent!

Our mains were the Brisket and Filet Mignon Pho and the Filet Mignon Green Curry:

Brisket and Filet Mignon Pho - The broth on this was easily the best that we've had in Austin! I want every pho from now on to feature Filet Mignon because...why the eff not, right? 1618's pho is a force to be reckoned with! Just wow!

Filet Mignon Green Curry - Hubby says that this was one of the best green curries of his LIFE! The amount of heat and sweet was spot on, and the filet made it BEYOND decadent, in the best way possible!

For dessert! Drumroll and belt-loosening:

Sticky Rice with Mango - We CANNOT! Enough said! This has ALWAYS been our Thai dessert go to, and 1618's is the one to beat! Judging by the fire and sparkles around us, there are probably much more decadently ridiculous options for dessert here, but we stuck with our reliable Thai meal ending, and it was perfect here!

Mark Lovelace, our server, by the by, was a dignified and understated cool cat with utterly impeccable grace and timing! Thank you, Mark! Truly! *tips hat*

1618 Asian Fusion,"I ordered the egg rolls and pho rib. They came out at the same time which is really disappointing that the servicer didn't know to space the appetizer from the main entree. That definitely impacted the overall food experience. Not being able to have my pho while it was hot because I was eating my appetizer as my main entree cooled at the table. The broth of the pho was good but the rib was so charred (meat very dry) that it made the broth bitter. I think a pho dish from this restaurant without the rib might actually taste great! I also ordered the lava bao (thank goodness I didn't put that in when I made my initial order) and they were below average compared to others I've had.

The star here is the PHO.  I'm a Pho snob since I lived in Hawaii with 20 different Pho places to choose from.  This broth took me back to my favorite Pho. As a bonus they use really good cuts of meat, unlike most places that use the dyed red Beef.   Their Pho is AWESOME!

So we got a Tropical Asian and the 1618 gin which were both half price and super yummy as we waited for a table: make a reservation! This place fills up fast!
Then we got the 3 appetizers off their happy hour menu to try them all and also the pork soup dumplings, and to share the yellow curry chicken entree which was spicy and hot... and oh-so-goooood!!

1618 Asian Fusion,"This place is beautiful. I love the effort this restaurant has taken to elevate asian food.

I visited after a hike in nearby Barton Creek. I was in need of some rehydration and there's no better way to rehydrate than a big bowl of pho.  This was a full on basin of pho. I was so stuffed and the oxtail was cooked perfectly and still fatty!  Yum  

My friends had veggie curry, chicken, and the most beautiful dish award winner: the Vietnamese bowl with shrimp. (I feel guilty for not taking a picture of it)

Next time I'm in this neck of the woods, I will waitlist ahead. I want to try the buns and the shao long bao (Soup Dumplings). This place is packed to the gills on a Wednesday, and many people left because they didn't want to wait. Our host squeezed the 5 of us into a 4 top, and we felt like we had enough space.

I also request that you open another restaurant near me in Stone Oak, San Antonio.

1618 Asian Fusion,"This is a great spot in Austin that more and more people are talking about, and for good reason too! We went for lunch on a weekend so we were able to avoid the crowds and the need to make reservations week in advance. We also were able to easily find parking in the nearby garage.

The ambience of the restaurant is very comfortable and the staff is warm and friendly from the moment you enter the door. For food we ordered the pineapple fried rice and the Peking duck. Both of which were excellent. The fried rice had the perfect amount of spice and great flavoring. The Peking duck was also amazing and I wanted to eat the whole thing but it was too much for me so I had to take it home.

Dim Sum - DO NOT GET weekend dim sum (Liu sha bao, custard bao, xiaolongbao). Go to 99 ranch and buy in packs. They taste exactly the same. (Well I'm wondering why?)

Lamb chop- i know inflation is around but why are they so small?

This curry - just taste like regular curry

Fish (forgot what it call see pic) - those are actually not bad. Way better than everything else. It's pricy but i really don't know what else are good here.

For the mains we split the half Peking Duck (which was on special that night) and an order of the Combo Fried Rice. All of it was absolute perfection. ALL of it to the last bite.

1618 Asian Fusion,"Had this place on our list for a long time so we finally went for a really nice dinner here for my birthday the other night. Would recommend reservations. We went on a weeknight so it wasn't too bad, but I've heard from others it can be a long wait as a walk-in.

Cocktails were decent, but most options looked VERY sweet (think rum, pineapple juice, etc). We got the Secretini and another lychee-focused drink, which were good but nothing mind-blowing.

Definitely recommend the sampler platter as we enjoyed the variety of tastes and textures, as well as the dim sum xiao dumplings. The sauces that accompany both these dishes are fun to try.

We shared the Peking duck as a main course, which was honestly a little ambitious for two people but it was our first time with this classic dish, and it was fantastic. The meat was perfectly flavorful and moist, while the skin was crispy like a potato chip with just the perfect amount of saltiness. We definitely needed take home boxes though.

Overall, I would definitely come again. The only aspect I would have changed is the redundancy of sweet flavors, whether it's in cocktail form or a sauce or marinade. My palate became a little fatigued from sweetness. But it was a memorable experience.","Food - Sampler Platter (enjoyed, liked the variety of tastes and textures), Dim Sum Xiao Dumplings (enjoyed, liked the taste), Peking Duck (fantastic, perfectly flavorful and moist duck, crispy skin, needed take-home boxes)||Drinks - Secretini (good), Lychee-focused drink (good)||Ambiance - Cozy and inviting||Service - Friendly and attentive "

They have many different drinks, matcha, beer, sake, coffee etc.

1618 Asian Fusion,"Came to eat here while on my visit to Austin to see a friend. The interior was very pretty, but the food for me was just ok. I was already a little hesitant at first when I saw the menu. Seeing that there was dim sum, Vietnamese, and Thai dishes got me worried, as that usually restaurants that have menus with multiple cuisines like this try to do too much and all the dishes end up being mediocre: lack of focus. Regardless, I went with my friend and gave this place a chance also knowing that they called themselves an asian fusion restaurant.

Crispy pad thai: This dish was the favorite thing I had from all the food I ate. I loved the texture of the crispy, fried noodles. My main gripe with the dish was the sauce. The sauce tasted good, but there was just so much of it that there was a big puddle of sauce on the plate. There was just way too much and made the whole dish overall less pleasing.

Five sampler: My favorite sampler from this appetizer was the egg rolls. The egg rolls were very similar to cha gio that you get at Vietnamese restaurants. Everything else was mediocre or worse. The chicken satay was just ok, the filling in the fried wontons was very, very dry, and the pork belly in the baos was surprisingly dry too.

Grill octopus: This appetizer was decent. The octopus had a slight, nice charred flavor, wish there was more. The dipping sauce complimented the octopus well.

Scallop dumpling: This was my least favorite dish of my meal. The whole piece was bland with little flavor. The dough had a weird texture for me as well

Not sure what the restaurant's concept of asian fusion was, but regardless of that, the food by itself was just not very tasty for me overall and not worth what I paid for it.","Food - Crispy pad thai (loved the texture of the crispy, fried noodles but hated the excessive sauce), Five Sampler(favorite was the egg rolls, least favorite was the dry chicken satay, dry fried wonton, and dry pork belly), Grill octopus (decent, slightly charred octopus, could be better), Scallop dumpling (bland, flavorless), Bao (dry, disappointing)||Ambiance - Pretty interior||Service - Friendly and attentive "

Service. Really good professional service.

Food, In my opinion..

* Thai tea - a little too milky.

* Filet green curry - Good plating. Lemongrass was hard and inedible, it should be removed from the dish. The curry had a really good flavor that overwhelmed the beef. The beef was cooked nicely but the flavor disappeared in the curry - so it was a waste.

* Pho rib - Rib meat cooked nicely and the flavor of the meat paired well with the pho. The pho broth was underwhelming, not enough spice.

I wanted to try dessert but thought it was best to cut my losses and get the check.

Started off with the clay pot rice and it was a lot smaller than I anticipated (I thought it would be like the big clay pot from traditional Cantonese restaurants). The rice was coated in sesame oil and the Chinese sausage was flavorful.

Soup dumplings - hot! They came out in the usual steaming basket and the skin is soft and the broth inside is very tasty.

Vietnamese bowl with grilled pork and egg rolls. The egg rolls were quite soggy so I didn't eat much of those. But the grilled pork was charred and seasoned so well. It was a light and fresh bowl but still filled you up.

1618 Asian Fusion,"Recently visited Austin and had been dying to try this place, so I made a reservation about 10 days before and I am so glad I did.

1618 really blew me away with their unique take on Asian cuisine. You walk in and the restaurant is very modern and decorated well (on my visit it was decorated for Halloween). There was a lot of attention to detail that went into the design. We were early for our reservation but were seated within a few minutes. The booths are very spacious and comfortable. We asked our waitress for recommendations because the menu was so huge and she gave us good ones. She was very attentive and helpful, great service!

We started with the grilled octopus which was unlike any other octopus i've ever had - it was cooked perfectly and flavored really well. We also got the five sampler which was a good way to try everything. The chicken satay and peanut sauce were very good, although we probably would have been fine with just 1 appetizer because there was a LOT of food.

I opted for the filet mignon curry and I am still dreaming of it, the filet was tender and the curry had unbelievable flavors that just exploded in your mouth. Never had a green curry that good. Other orders at the table were the Rib Pho, with the rib meat falling off the bone and the bowl put together at the table, the spicy red curry, and the crispy pad thai. The crispy pad thai was really unique and tasty. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their meal.

1618 is a great place to come with your friends or on date night for a more upscale thai/vietnamese fusion experience that will have you wanting to come back and try everything on the menu.","Food - Grilled Octopus (unique, perfect), Five Sampler (good), Chicken Satay and Peanut Sauce (very good), Filet Mignon Curry (tender, flavorful), Rib Pho (falling bone rib meat), Spicy Red Curry (good), Crispy Pad Thai (unique, tasty)||Ambiance - Modern, decorated||Service - Attentive, helpful "
1618 Asian Fusion,"Went here for one of my girl's bachelorette dinners and it was so yummy! Definitely good for groups. Their crispy pad Thai was so flavorful and their calamari was so yummy! Their Vietnamese coffee was also great. Their cocktail menu is very diverse from sweet to strong, they have it all! Like their name says, they have fusion of all different Asian cuisines (Chinese, Thai, and Vietnamese) and all of us ordered all three, which 1618 did not disappoint. Would definitely come here again and try more!","Food - Crispy Pad Thai (flavorful), Calamari (yummy), Vietnamese Coffee (great)||Ambiance - Cozy and inviting||Service - Friendly and attentive "
1618 Asian Fusion,"The fact that this place has so many high reviews is indicative of the fact that 1) Austin is a super white city and doesn't know what quality authentic Asian food tastes like 2) the bar is on the floor when it comes to good Asian food.

That's really the only reasons I can fathom that this place is rated so highly. I was convinced to come here 4 times, hoping that the other times was just a hiccup but it really wasn't. Every time I got a different dish and was disappointed. The food is not good.

Pros: the interior is designed beautifully, the service is good and they have a decent bar. I suspect this is the ""wow"" factor for why this place is rated so highly. People get drunk and don't realize that what they're eating lacks flavor, freshness or any resemblance to authentic Vietnamese food.","Food - Egg rolls (lacked crispy texture), Pork soup dumplings (undercooked and dry), Combo fried rice (tasted the same as pork soup dumplings, lacked flavor), Shrimp panang curry (started great but got sweeter, needed some acid to balance sweetness)||Ambiance - Beautiful interior||Service - Good||Menu - Decent||Price - high "

1618 Asian Fusion,"You won't go wrong with a stop at 1618 Asian Fusion. I came on my first night in Austin with my family and it did not disappoint.

If you're visiting with a group of friends, family or simply your date, you must order the Five Sampler. It's perfect for sharing and offers a little bit for everyone. My husband and I enjoyed everything this appetizer has to offer.

Make your way down to the entree and order the Pad Thai but beware it is spicy yet so good. I can tolerate some spice and this started off as that, but did get to me after a few bites. Don't be scared though because it's so delicious. This dish was shared by two people.

Can't forget the protein. We really enjoyed the Filet Mignon Stir Fry Onion. It was cooked to perfection with its sauce and onions. And this dish was also shared by two people.

If you're looking to end dinner on a sweet note, the raspberry cheesecake is to die for. It's topped with a raspberry syrup and goes perfectly with plain cheesecake.","Food - Five Sampler(good), Pad Thai(spicy but delicious), Filet Mignon Stir Fry Onion(cooked to perfection, sauce and onions were delicious), Raspberry Cheesecake(die for)||Ambiance - Nice||Service - Friendly and attentive "

1618 Asian Fusion,"Enjoyed a really good dinner tonight visiting Austin! I searched best Asian food and this spot popped up so it made the list. The wait was 45 min on a Saturday night. We enjoyed the live music and atmosphere.

The menu is not very big but the choices are high quality and upscale Asian. My husband and I tried the shrimp balls, pho, bok choy and salt and pepper shrimp.

The shrimp balls are different with a crispy potato crust but taste like fried shrimp. It was unique but not necessarily a special flavor.

The bok choy surprisingly as my favorite as it was sautÃ©ed with fried garlic and onions in a garlic sauce. I ate the whole bowl like a meal. Really yummy if you are a veggie lover. My husband like his shrimp pho and I tried the broth and it was exquisite. The waitress told us they have awards for the pho and I can see that.

The salt and pepper shrimp had really good flavor and the presentation was beautiful.

My only issue was having to send my food back to be warmed up as all of it came out Luke warm.

We enjoyed the lechee martini and watermelon cucumber drink the best. The blueberry smash had a nice presentation but it tasted like watered down flat blueberry soda.
Great dinner, service and experience.","Food - Shrimp balls (unique but not special flavor), Bok Choy (favorite, sauted with fried garlic and onions, yummy), Pho (exquisite broth), Salt and Pepper Shrimp (good flavor, beautiful presentation), Lechee Martini (enjoyed), Watermelon Cucumber drink (best), Blueberry Smash (watered down flat blueberry soda)||Music - Live||Ambiance - Live music||Service - great||Menu - High-quality Asian||Wait - 45 minutes "

1618 Asian Fusion,"My recent visit to 1618 Fusion was an absolute delight! From the moment we walked in, we were greeted with warmth and hospitality. The restaurant had a cozy yet elegant atmosphere that instantly set the tone for a wonderful evening.

First and foremost, I must commend our waitress, Shaira. She was a true gem who went above and beyond to ensure our dining experience was memorable. Her knowledge of the menu was impressive, and she expertly guided us through the wide variety of delectable dishes. Shaira's friendly demeanor and attentiveness made us feel right at home. She helped us choose what to order and they were all delicious, as described below.

Now, let's talk about the food! We started our culinary journey with the Pineapple Fried Rice, which was an explosion of flavors. The delicate balance of sweetness from the pineapple, combined with the savory notes of the rice and perfectly cooked shrimp, was simply outstanding. It was a dish that satisfied both our taste buds and our eyes.

Next up was the Salt and Pepper Shrimp, and it was love at first bite! The shrimp were incredibly crispy on the outside, while still remaining tender and succulent inside. The seasoning was spot-on, adding a delightful kick to every mouthwatering bite. It was impossible to resist reaching for more.

As if that wasn't enough, we also indulged in the Filet Mignon Fried Onion. The presentation alone was impressive, but the taste surpassed all expectations. The tender filet mignon, cooked to perfection, paired beautifully with the fried onions, creating a heavenly combination. Each bite was a symphony of flavors that left us wanting more.

To end our meal on a sweet note, we ordered the Ube Panna Cotta and the FlambÃ©. The Ube Panna Cotta was a revelation. The vibrant purple color was visually stunning, and the silky smooth texture melted in our mouths. The subtle hints of ube provided a unique twist to this classic dessert. The FlambÃ© was a showstopper, prepared tableside with flair.

Overall, 1618 Fusion exceeded all our expectations. The quality of the food, combined with the exceptional service provided by Shaira, made it an unforgettable dining experience. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a fusion of flavors, impeccable service, and a truly remarkable meal.","Food - Pineapple Fried Rice (outstanding), Salt and Pepper Shrimp (crispy with spot-on seasoning), Filet Mignon Fried Onion (tender with flavorful combination), Ube Panna Cotta (revelation, visual impact, silky smooth texture), Flambe (showstopper, prepared tableside with flair)||Service - Exceptional, guide to the menu, attentive "

I will probably come back to try their coffee and dessert.","Food was ok, not amazing, but you can find better in other places. The pad Thai was way too sweet, I could barely taste the fish sauce or the lime. The tofu was over cooked. I had the yellow curry with chicken. It started out great, but got sweeter. I couldn't finish it. I don't recommend the coconut rice. It's just not good. The Thuk, while being super tasty, is a bit too spicy for me. I like my spice fix in my curries, not in my mouth. Overall, it's a nice place to try if you want to see and be seen. The staff is pretty attentive. I prefer places where the servers actually interact with you instead of just taking your order and bringing the food. [/INST]"
1618 Asian Fusion,"If you're familiar with the Austin food scene, then you've probably visited several hyped-up spots that end up not living up to said hype...that's not the case for 1618 Asian Fusion.

1618 Asian Fusion,"What a cool experience! Immediately I knew I would probably like this dining experience just by the way people were eating, sharing stories and enjoying a wide variety of options. I chose the vegetarian green curry and tofu spring rolls. I was not disappointed. The curry was so flavorful and not overly spicy. I could really taste the different undertones and spices. The fresh rolls were just plain delicious! I'd go back just for those! Portions are moderate and I feel that it was very appropriately priced.

The vibe was great, so was the service! I recommend 1618 to anyone in the mood for something different.","Food - Vegetarian Green Curry (flavorful, not overly spicy), Tofu Spring Rolls (delicious)||Ambiance - Cool, great vibe||Service - Great||Price - Appropriate "
1618 Asian Fusion,"We had to wait about 15-20 minutes, but there's a comfy seat and you can get a drink by the bar, so not a problem! Although the place does get very busy so I recommend you book in advance! All staff members were fantastic and prompt!

Food;
We had chicken dumplings, calamari - both were very good! Dumplings weren't 'wow' and calamari was a little salty and peppery, but I think the menu says it! Overall they were all good :) we wanted to have some steamed buns but they didn't have any.

Main- we had pad Thai and coconut rice (with chicken)
Pad Thai was yummy but (obviously don't expect it would be like a pad Thai from Thailand), coconut rice was also good but again, it wasn't a 'wow'. It seemed a little dry and we both preferred pad Thai more. But it could be the fact that we were already pretty full when our coconut rice arrived! I'd prefer to try the yellow curry next time I visit!

Coco me crazy drink was my fav! Oh I'd def come for another! Lycheen and Asian cocktails were good too, but if you like coconut, go coco crazy!

For dessert, rather than having sweet cake we had custard steamed buns (appetizer) because we really wanted some buns!

I must say, I'm from an Asian country, so Asian food from the west are not very comparable. I've had better buns for sure, but it wasn't bad. I'd say overall the food seemed a little less moist than I'm used to in Korea or Thailand.

Tips: what we did was order several appetizers (dumplings) and 1 main to share, then order another main (if there's still room) during our 1st main or some dessert to share afterwards. That way our food was always hot! They have a platter (spring rolls) which also looked good!

Also be prepared to feel a little guilty the next day because you couldn't stop eating or drinking..","Food - Chicken Dumplings (good), Calamari (very good, salty and peppery), Pad Thai (yummy but dry), Coconut Rice (good but dry), Coco Crazy (favorite), Custard Steamed Bun (good), Spring Rolls (looked good)||Service - Fantastic and prompt||Ambiance - Comfy seats||Menu - Huge "

1618 Asian Fusion,"Incredible ambiance and menu, and a definite must-try. I've been here twice now: once for Valentine's Day, and once this week.

The first time at Asian Fusion, I got the sampler appetizer plate and the pad Thai. Both were amazing and I highly recommend both! We went for dinner on Valentine's Day and the lighting and live music made the place feel very special. Great music and excellent atmosphere.

We went again last night and wow -- if you are reading this, GET THE SOUP DUMPLINGS. I ended up ordering another round of them because they were just too good. I went home that night dreaming of their soup dumplings and thinking about swinging by soon to get some to go. They are that good. Trust me, you will not regret getting these.

I loved the pad Thai the first time, and noticed that they also offer a ""crispy"" version, so I tried that. Well... It wasn't what I expected. I thought they would just crisp up the noodles by cooking the pad Thai a bit more, but it's a completely different dish -- see my pictures below! It might be your thing, because I'm not saying it was bad, but I wouldn't order it again. Next time, I'll stick with the normal pad Thai.

The five sampler is a great deal to get a little bit of everything, and again, get the xiao long bao soup dumplings. I will 1000% be back for those alone!","Food - Sampler Plate (recommended), Pad Thai (normal), Crispy Pad Thai (not good)||Ambiance - Incredible||Music - Live music||Menu - Huge "

Thomas was our server for this wonderful night and he was very knowledgeable with every question I asked.

The food was amazing and definitely hit home. My favorite bite of the evening was the Scallop&Chive Dumpling. As for dessert I highly recommend the ""Flambeau Everest Cheesecake"". The preparation Thomas did to dress the cheesecake had great showmanship. The dessert itself was delicious with every bite and the melting texture with the sugar crystals made it even more enjoyable.

I will definitely come back here for their future seasonal creations. Thank you Thomas and the kind staff at 1618.

Our group of 8 was able to order a number of their offerings.  These are the items we were the most fond of: calamari, salted pepper; saigon chicken wings and the banh trang da nang (viet pizza).  

Calamari is calamari so was surprised at how good these were--solid battering and sauce.  Balanced flavor on the chicken wings.  The viet pizza was a clear hit with us, and we could not stop raving about it!

Service was awesome.  Waiter kept checking up on us and helped us move to be in the shade.  This involved moving the tables, chairs and also the repositioning the canopy shading.  We had lunch and chose outdoors.  Be warned--not all tables will be shaded.

Apparently it was somebody else who was supposed to bring back my change but never did.
Whatever, so I decided to come again and not pay with cash. Didn't have any problem. Food was amazing. I got the grilled octopus and the lamb. Amazing texture and even better sauce.

1618 Asian Fusion,"I don't even know where to start, 1618 is a mix of theatrics and delightfully tasty cuisine.

1618 Asian Fusion,"I know Elon came here and all but I'm just going to say it... 1618 isn't good Asian food. It's bland. The restaurant is nice but the 3x I've tried something it taste like what it's trying for but misses the mark in either tartness, spice, or sweetness.

1. Appetizers sampler consist mostly deep fried food that you couldn't tell what you were eating - ground up ..stuff, fat?
2. $85 fried fish is really just sweet and sour fish, no where near the tamarind Thai sauce. Unsophisticated, straight sugar and vinigar .
3. Featured four seasons duck was barely edible. While the duck pieces were ok although just luck warm, the cause taste and smell gasoline we names it gasoline duck.
After the meal, we felt like we just ate something really unhealthy, fatty oily and unsatisfying .

1618 Asian Fusion,"Pretty good Asian fusion place in Austin. Prices are on the higher side compared to some other Asian restaurants, but the quality and presentation make up for it. My favorite dishes were: duck skewers, yellow curry, and Peking duck. One thing they could improve on is the timing of the dishes. We had a large party and ordered a lot, but they brought out all the entrees and appetizers out at once, which caused some of the food to get cold by the time we got to try it. I thought the filet mignon was too chewy, so I would pass on that one.

Then we got our order togo, she even gave us 1 pair of chopsticks  for 3 people, with 2 dishes inside. Maybe she thought we can use our hands to grabs the food!!!

1618 Asian Fusion,"I came here based on a recommendation and it was an excellent choice. We had a reservation as the restaurant was pretty busy on a Thursday evening. That's definitely a good sign for them because it was still early in the night. They have both indoor and outdoor tables (which quickly filled up as we were dining). The restaurant is quite large and can accommodate parties too in their private room.  

Be sure to arrive for their happy hour specials. They have a great menu of items for $5. I decided to give all of them a try :). I guarantee you won't be disappointed if you take my suggestion: chicken sui mai, pan fry cilantro shrimp, and shrimp and pork wontons. We also had an order of house sake to go with it all. We also had a plate of salt and pepper calamari too.

For the main we had the Peking duck. It was served with scallions, hoisin sauce, steamed buns (Southern style) and green onions. I was quite impressed with the quality of the duck and the presentation too. The duck skin was crisp, not oily and carved without the bones. I was told this is one of their most popular dishes and it lived up to the expectations. It does take a lot of preparation work for these ducks and the dish really shined (literally, see the pictures).

Dessert did not disappoint. The Hanoi coffee with egg custard poured over an espresso was the finale of meal service.

Service was excellent. I would like to recognize Catherine for coming by to thank us for our patronage and to also invite us back in the future for their pho rib which I am excited to try upon my return. We also accidentally left our wallet at the table and they were very prompt to call us back by phone before we left the parking lot.

Qi Austin,"This is a late post, but I had an unforgettable experience there back in July. I was visiting from out of town and my cousin had recommended Qi Austin.  To be quite honest, it wasn't on my radar because I had come with an Austin foodie list of things to try but decided to proceed and  trust his judgement.

My party and I were served by Danny who was incredibly knowledgable and had the BEST recommendations for dinner. Drink knowledge was very impressive too. I had worked in the restaurant industry for over 10 years so I knew I was being helped by someone who was very good at their job. So we had full faith to have him decide pretty much our entire dinner. There were a couple of dishes we added to the list but the rest was taken care of by Danny. We enjoyed the food but we enjoyed the service even more. If we didn't have Danny as your server then we know we wouldn't have had the same memorable experience. Promote the man! He knows what he's doing!",Food - Enjoyable||Service - Exceptional||Ambiance - Nice 
Qi Austin,"Qi is a hidden gem that takes you on an authentic culinary journey through the diverse and exquisite flavors of China. Located in the heart of the city, this restaurant promises a memorable dining experience.

Our culinary journey began with an array of delectable appetizers. The Dim Sum Platter was a standout, featuring delicate dumplings filled with a variety of fillings, from succulent shrimp to flavorful pork. The pan-fried spring rolls were perfectly crispy, and the dipping sauces added a burst of flavor.

For the main course, we opted for a mix of dishes from different regions of China. The Peking Duck was a showstopper, with thin, crispy skin and tender meat. The traditional table-side carving added a touch of drama to the experience. The Sichuan Kung Pao Chicken packed a spicy punch with its fiery chili peppers, and the Mapo Tofu was a silky, spicy delight.

The Stir-Fried Shanghai Noodles showcased the chef's skill with wok cooking, and the flavors were spot-on. We also tried the fragrant Cantonese-style Steamed Fish, which was incredibly fresh and accompanied by a light ginger and soy sauce.

The restaurant boasts an extensive drink menu, including a variety of Chinese teas and a well-curated selection of wines and cocktails. We paired our meal with a fragrant jasmine tea that complemented the flavors perfectly.

Qi is a hidden treasure for those seeking an authentic Chinese dining experience. From the ambiance that transports you to China to the attentive service and the diverse, flavorful dishes, this restaurant is a must-visit for lovers of Chinese cuisine. The only reason for not awarding a full five stars is that, at times, the restaurant can be a bit crowded during peak hours. Nevertheless, it's a culinary journey worth embarking on.","Food - Dim Sum Platter (standout), Pan-fried spring rolls (crispy), Peking Duck (showstopper), Sichuan Kung Pao Chicken (spicy punch), Mapo Tofu (silky, spicy), Stir-Fried Shanghai Noodles (spot-on), Cantonese-style Steamed Fish (fresh)||Drinks - Extensive menu, Chinese teas "
Qi Austin,"Chef Ling brings everything you love about Lin,  elevated. And unlike so many restaurants that suffer after opening multiple locations, Qi is every bit as consistent, with that high dining service and atmosphere.

Shanghai dumplings are like none else, if Michelin were in Texas these would be top of their list. I branched out this time and was able to try the Lobster dumpling, more subtle, slightly sweet, still layers of complexity. I've never had a potsticker knock my socks off - this one WILL - Akaushi beef seasoned with a touch of scallion, gently steamed and reminiscent of tartare, with a crispy crown of lacy wrapper, soaking up just the right ratio of sauce. A treat! Ingredients in the fried rice were generous and fresh, but the dish was generally under seasoned, leaving room for intervention. Noodles were much better. Egg drop soup is rich but light, with the most delightful texture of egg to contrast with little fresh kernels of corn. I had the spicy shrimp in air-battered tempura with scallions & jalapeÃ±os. Very simple, straightforward, but lovely, balanced, sweet, peppery, spicy, a delight. Danny is a lovely host, helped guide us through the menu and towards a Sancerre that cut the fats just right.

Aside from sharing lunch with friends, knowing the dim sum brunch is an even better way to tour around the menu, I love that Qi is a similarly appropriate venue for a casual business lunch as it is a sentimental occasion, or (recommended) taking the large table to sample every entree on the menu paired with very fine wine & sake selections with all your friends.","Food - Shanghai Soup Dumplings (loved, wanted more), Lobster Dumpling (subtle, slightly sweet), Potsticker (knockout), Fried Rice (generous, fresh but under seasoned), Noodles (much better), Egg Drop Soup (rich but light),spicy shrimp in air-battered tempura with scallions & jalapenos (simple, straightforward, lovely, balanced, sweet, peppery, spicy, delight)||Service - Lovely, helpful with recommendations||Location - Appropriate for various occasions||Drinks - Fine wine and sake selections "

The drinks were very good according to my party! And they were very attentive to us. Our server was supper knowledgeable on the dishes/drinks they had to offer.

Everything here is ""family"" portions so get it to share. The food was good, but it wasn't amazing. I have definitely had better. The soup dumplings came with a cup (usually a big spoon) that you drink the soup from, but the cup just made it a little harder to enjoy tie dumpling.

Qi Austin,"My husband read about the @qiaustinrestaurant and wanted to celebrate his birthday early there. Made reservations for the Wu clan.

You know it's a true foodie who would drive 2 hours one way for good food! I'm surprised yet thankful for free parking in the garage. We started off with 2 different Soup Dumplings: Shanghai and Crab Meat Fish Maw. These were almost double the size of ones in San Antonio and contain a lot of soup! The orange tea cups are especially to catch the soup as you bite into the dumpling! We ordered the Peking Duck, Whole Red Snapper in soy ginger sauce, Truffle Egg Fried Rice, Combination Fried Rice, Braised Oxtail, Honey Akaushi Beef, Pork Belly (cooked 24 hours), Sesame Chicken, and Seasonal Vegetable with Bird Nest. I felt as if I was transported to NYC's Chinatown. Phenomenal food!

The 2 not-so-stellar dishes were the Honey Akaushi Beef and the Red Snapper. Some that had the beef had tender pieces, but I ended up with chewy ones. The fish was overcooked. Kris was an excellent server and the food came out quickly.

Overall, food was very good.  The place had a nice vibe, slightly on the loud side.  I sat at the bar and that was cool watching them make all of the dumplings.  Tad pricy but I would return!

Chicken Egg Rolls: 5/10 mostly wrapper flavored

Qi Austin,"Service was good. Sat outside with mist fans so in the summer time on a Friday evening it was tolerable.
Truffle fries rice - so smooth. Just like any Asian food it's amazing the next day. I was ok with the truffle shaving on top. I didn't need anymore. It was so silky smooth.

Qi Austin,"A Chinese brunch spot adorned with exquisite decor. Suitable for both a casual outing with your parents or a date night.

The food is good, though not exceptionally unique:

The soup dumplings were satisfying, yet the filling lacked cohesiveness.
The pickle platter stood out with its excellent assortment of cucumber, daikon, and jellyfish.
The salt and pepper shrimp entree, while enjoyable, was a tad oily.","Food - Soup Dumplings (good but lacked cohesiveness), Pickle Platter (excellent assortment), Salt and Pepper Shrimp (enjoyable but oily)||Ambiance - Exquisite décor||Service - Suitable for various occasions "
Qi Austin,"Hands down the best dim sum in town. We had a fantastic brunch experience at Qi. You must get the soup dumplings - the shrimp and seafood were the best. The salt and pepper shrimp ( a recommendation from our server) was expertly seasoned and makes me want to come back for dinner to try more of their traditional menu. The scallion and duck pancake items were so flavorful and delicious. The atmosphere is elegant, fun, and upscale. Our server made excellent recommendations. Would absolutely recommend making reservations. This is a must try restaurant if you are in the area.","Food - Soup Dumplings (best in town), Salt and Pepper Shrimp (expertly seasoned, recommended), Scallion and Duck Pancake (flavorful, delicious)||Ambiance - Elegant, fun, upscale||Service - Excellent recommendations "
Qi Austin,"Came here for the first time to celebrate my bf's birthday for the first time and just like the other restaurants in this group, enjoyed our meal.

Dumplings are the star of the show here so make sure you order some, especially the soup dumplings. We also ordered the mustard greens, duck pancakes, zha jiang noodles, and the whole fried fish. I'd probably skip out on the noodles next time, but everything was flavorful and delicious. FYI everything is served meant to share.

The restaurant is also gorgeous and they have enough seating for large groups if you reserve ahead of time. Another plus is an attached garage with free parking for dining guests.

The only reason why I'm giving it 4 stars is because I prefer the ""homestyle"" experience of dining at a Chinese restaurant. However, this place is definitely worth the visit!","Food - Dumplings (star of the show), Mustard Greens (flavorful and delicious), Duck Pancakes (flavorful and delicious), Zha Jiang Noodles (skip), Whole Fried Fish (flavorful and delicious)||Ambiance - Gorgeous||Parking - Free||Service - Excellent "
Qi Austin,"This place was highly rated when I was looking for a dm sum spot in Austin. It was also highly recommended by a friend as well to stop by try. Glad we listened and decided to come. So let's get this review started.

Ambience:

The place was very modern looking and especially the decor inside. I loved how it looked. Beautifully designed and pretty dark inside. The seating arrangement was sort of bunched together a bit. Oh my... the chairs were really exquisite. It was comfy but also the design was pretty nice. I just really loved their decor.

Service:

We went when it just opened, so it wasn't that bad. You could make a reservation ahead of time, but it wasn't necessary at the time we went. We were greeted by the host and then seated at a table when we entered. Our waitress was really lovely too. She was wonderful and helpful as well. She was a real delight. The way to order here is almost like a typical dim sum place. They give you a set menu and then you basically just mark down how many orders you want on the menu. Food came out pretty fast as soon as you place your order on the paper. So it wasn't that long of a wait to fill our bellies.

Food:

Oh the food! What can I say about the food. Absolutely wonderful. We enjoyed every dish that we ordered. We also ordered the typical items that we usually order at dim sum. Luckily they had the items we always ordered. Their menu for dim sum was a bit restricted, but it still had a good amount of variety to it. We ordered harrow, xis mai, bbq buns, custard buns and a lobster filled dumpling I believe. We got that one because it was in the shape of a rabbit. Very cute! We left here with full and satisfied.

Would we come again? Probably if we come back to Austin to visit.","Food - Har gow (good), siu mai (good), BBQ buns (good), custard buns (good), lobster filled dumplings (good)||Ambiance - Modern, beautifully designed, dark, exquisite chairs, bunched seating||Service - Lovely, helpful, delightful, fast "
Qi Austin,"If you're looking for some up-scale Chinese food, Qi can certainly hit the spot. First of all, the ambience is really nice. Note that you'll probably need a reservation ahead of time. But if you are a party of 1 or 2, there's almost always immediate seating at the bar or area in front of the kitchen.

I haven't tried everything off their menu, but there are some major hits everyone should try:

Basil Chicken Dumplings - For a dish that frankly sounds unassuming, these dumplings are a knockout. Must try if you want dumplings. The sauce that comes with it enhances it to another level.

Shrimp Har Gow - These are just done really well. The shrimp inside tastes fantastic and the texture of outer starchy skin is amazing. Probably the best Har Gow I've tried.

Honey Akaushi Beef -  WOW. If there is anything that makes Qi deserving of the 5 star review, it is this dish here. I have never had anything like this. The beef is cooked so perfectly, with a nice outer crust. Once you bite into it, it is like an explosion of delicious beef flavor.  And the sauce is this well balanced mixing of honey and pepper that hits all the senses. My parents visited me in Austin and they were so impressed by this dish as well.

My only gripe with this restaurant is their pekin duck entree. Everything tasted great, but they only provided ~3-4 bao to make your duck ""tacos."" And if you want more, you have to pay $1.50 for each extra bao! I'm not sure why they are nickle-and-diming so hard for this bread. Other Chinese restaurants give plenty.","Food - Basil Chicken Dumplings (knockout, sauce enhances), Shrimp Har Gow (done really well, fantastic shrimp), Honey Akaushi Beef (WOW, perfectly cooked beef, delicious flavor explosion), Pekin Duck (great taste, limited bao)||Ambiance - Nice||Service - Good||Price - Extra charge for additional bao "
Qi Austin,"Always a good time and good food when coming here! Plan ahead & Make sure you make reservations so you're not waiting because there will be a wait, especially on the weekends.

The service here is always amazing, I love that they have whiskey cocktails Available and they make them well! Everything I've tried here is pretty darn good but my favorites are the truffle fried rice, singapore crispy whole fish, and their imperial Tofu!

Qi Austin,"A culinary delight awaits at this establishment, accompanied by attentive staff who gladly elucidate the diverse menu offerings. I relished the truffle egg fried rice and Shanghai dumplings - both a perfect match for my palate. My visit encountered no delays, and the interior's aesthetic charm, featuring subtle yet inviting lighting, left a lasting impression. Heartily recommended, this spot beckons with a warm ambiance. Without a doubt, I'll return for another meal whenever I find myself in Austin again!","Food - Truffle egg fried rice (relished), Shanghai dumplings (perfect match)||Service - Attentive, elucidate diverse menu||Ambiance - Warm, inviting interior "
Qi Austin,"This restaurant has really yummy, cute food, mice devor and ambiance, and friendly staff. You can ask the waiter for what vegan options they have as they don't have a dedicated vegan menu, but can definitely male accomodations.

My friend likes getting the chicken rats or whatever they're made of. They are super cute!

I usually get vegan dumplings or salt and pepper tofu. Super yummy!","Food - Vegan Dumplings (yummy), Salt and Pepper Tofu (yummy)||Ambiance - Nice Devor - Mouse "
Qi Austin,"For me, Qi is a great spot for a variety of Dim Sum small plates, shareable entrees, and a cozy / dimly lit evening out.

I definitely recommend their house special soup dumplings, truffle fried rice, and the whole fish (photo attached). The presentation, portion sizes, and quality of food do not disappoint. I think it's a great spot for a date night, evening with colleagues/clients, or any time you want to splurge or impress.

Make a reservation in advance, and be sure to check in up front with the staff when you arrive! Plenty of complementary parking spots on the fourth floor of the adjacent garage behind the front of the restaurant.","Food - House Special Soup Dumplings (recommended), Truffle Fried Rice (recommended), Whole Fish (recommended)||Location - Cozy and dimly lit||Parking - Complementary spots available||Service - Friendly and attentive "
Qi Austin,"We really wanted soup dumplings, so we went for lunch and stopped by this place. This place is very nicely decorated. All the details are thought out to the smallest detail. We were not greeted with a smile, but were immediately asked if we had a reservation. The service was not very good. No one asked if we wanted drinks. The drinks we ordered never arrived and I had to ask for them a second time. The soup dumplings were actually very tasty. The entrees, on the other hand, were flat. We ordered the chicken with pine nuts and the Berkshire pork, but it was just not flavorful. Maybe we ordered it wrong. Hard to tell as the staff didn't give us any instructions.","Food - Soup Dumplings (very tasty), Chicken with Pine Nuts (not flavorful), Berkshire Pork (not flavorful)||Ambiance - Nicely decorated||Service - Lackluster, no smile, slow||Drinks - Ordered but never arrived "

Qi Austin,"Upscale Chinese fusion restaurant with beautiful ambiance, but a hefty price tag. I've dined here twice and my opinion hasn't changed much. I've tried a number of dim sum appetizers here and the Shanghai soup dumplings continue to be the best relative to the other options. Although, in comparison with other pork soup dumplings I've had at different establishments, this one falls to the bottom. The dough is too thick and vastly overpowers the under-seasoned filling. $13 for 5 pieces is also on the steep side. The peking duck was acceptable. It came with a pate you spread across the bao for flavor. There are only 3 baos that come with the order so expect disproportionate portions. I prefer my peking duck be wrapped thin pancakes or wraps, but unfortunately they don't offer that here. I much prefer the duck at Bamboo House or Jade at a much reasonable cost with more authentic flavors. The truffle fried rice was very underwhelming. Something that can easily be made at home. The only toppings it consisted of were egg and maybe 2 shavings of truffle. For a restaurant that encourages family style meals, the pork belly was really the only dish that was abundant. Unfortunately, it was doused in a sauce that didn't highlight the protein. The bird nest was probably the best thing that was ordered during this visit. The vegetables were seasoned nicely and the nest it was held in provided a satisfying crunch.

For dessert, we got the mango bomb and the fly me to the moon. I found the mango bomb a bit too tart the more bites I took, but fly me to the moon was finished off in a blink of an eye. Overall, if you're looking to spend a pretty penny, there are plenty of other options to choose from with beautiful ambiance and better bang for your buck. If you're looking for more authentic flavors, best to look elsewhere.","Food - Shanghai Soup Dumplings (best relative to other options, falls to the bottom compared to other pork soup dumplings), Peking Duck (acceptable, disproportionate portions for baos), Truffle Fried Rice (underwhelming, lacked toppings), Pork Belly (doused in sauce that didn't highlight protein), Bird Nest (best, seasoned vegetables, satisfying crunch), Mango Bomb (bit too tart), Fly Me To The Moon (finished off quickly)||Ambiance - Beautiful, modern and traditional mix||Price - high||Service - friendly and attentive "
Qi Austin,"I was a little skeptical when my friend suggested ""upscale"" dim sum in Austin. both because I prefer my dim sum with no frills and because I hadn't found many great Asian places in the city. Street parking might not be the easiest but there's a parking garage for the building that Qi is located in. We were able to quickly get seating at the bar, which provides the best view of the steamers, woks, stock pots and chefs in action.

Crab meat corn soup: substantial lumps of crab, warm, comforting soup. Great with some of the chili oil that you can ask for on the side
Asian fried chicken: tender and juicy, seemed to be roasted rather than deep fried. Sauce of palm sugar and lime is addictive.
Pan sear basil chicken dumpling: never had Thai holy basil in a dumpling before, but it works. Thin wrapper and just lightly crispy.
Szechuan peppercorn alligator: battered pieces of alligator with some toasted chilies, peppercorn, and scallion. Similar in texture to chicken and good flavor, but definitely more suitable for sharing family style.
Truffle egg fried rice - in my opinion, a bit on the drier side though it's typical to use day-old rice. Yolk is mixed with each grain of rice to give a golden hue, and the yolk and earthy truffle flavor makes for a really fragrant bite. I think the truffle shaving on top could have been a bit thinner and maybe some scallions to garnish would have ben nice
Tingling daisy: probably the most unique cocktail I've had. You're supposed to take a nibble of the peppercorn flower in between sips for a little numbing sensation.

Overall, definitely a spot worth trying out in Austin when you're looking to splurge a little. Cozy and dim atmosphere with great food, would definitely return!","Food - Crab Meat Corn Soup (substantial lumps, comforting), Asian Fried Chicken (tender and juicy), Pan Seared Basil Chicken Dumpling (thin wrapper, lightly crispy), Szechuan Peppercorn Alligator (battered pieces, similar in texture to chicken, good flavor, suitable for sharing), Truffle Egg Fried Rice (on the drier side, bit too much rice), Tingling Daisy (unique cocktail, numbing sensation from nibbling on the peppercorn flower)||Ambiance - Cozy and dim||Service - Great||Parking - Available||Menu - Huge "
Qi Austin,"Qi Austin is located at the very bottom of what seems to be a corporate office and you can definitely tell that people come here for lunch. I would highly recommend making a reservation because it fills up pretty quickly and that is the first thing they ask when walking in.

The service was pretty good and I was attended to frequently and the servers make sure to take your plate once you finish.

I went during lunch and ordered the

-Shanghai Soup Dumplings - The soup dumplings were very savory especially with the vinegar they provide. It came in 5, and we devoured it almost instantly.
-Shrimp Hargow - The shrimp hargow also came in 5. The quality of ingredients used were extraordinary. Again, it was devoured pretty quickly.
-Lunch Sesame Chicken - The lunch size is relatively small and is the perfect size in my opinion. The outer crust was super crispy paired with the sweet sauce made the dish very good.
-Lunch Akaushi Beef - The sauce is a little bit on the sour side, which didnt sit too well with me. However, the beef and vegetables itself were cooked to perfection and was super savory. I give the beef a 4.9/5.

All in all, I highly recommend Qis. It is on the pricer side for dim sum and their dim sum menu is relatively small, however their lunch specials more than make up for it.","Food - Shanghai Soup Dumplings (very savory, devoured quickly), Shrimp Hargow (extraordinary quality), Lunch Sesame Chicken (super crispy, very good), Lunch Akaushi Beef (sour sauce, cooked to perfection, savory beef and vegetables)||Location - Bottom of corporate office, busy during lunch||Service - Attentive, frequent||Price - slightly high "
Qi Austin,"Need date night ideas...come to Qi Austin!  Our table ordered a multitude of items.  Honestly couldn't tell you the name of some of them, but everything I tried was absolutely delicious! My favorite was the Sugarcane Shrimp, Truffle Fried Rice & Dumplings. I also learned there is a certain way to eat a dumpling.  1st time eating a dumpling. Shame on me. But now I know the proper way and will be back for more. The Zha Jiang Noodle was my least favorite.  It wasn't bad, but I just like noodles that have more sauce. If you come with a larger group it's a fun spot to share a few plates. Although I will say between two people the Half Peking Duck & Zha Jiang Noodle is more than enough. I'll be back for date night!","Food - Sugarcane Shrimp (favorite), Truffle Fried Rice (favorite), Dumplings (absolutely delicious, favorite), Zha Jiang Noodle (Not bad, prefer noodles with more sauce)||Ambiance - Fun spot for date night||Service - Friendly and attentive "
Qi Austin,"Qi's is an upscale dim sum and Chinese cuisine restaurant. Not only is the decor beautiful, but the food and service was good as well.

The interior of Qi's is nicely decorated with a mix of modern and traditional.

The service was phenomenal! The servers consistently checked up on us throughout the time and were very attentive, and after being seated, they pass out intricate designed plates and small bowls.

I ordered the Shanghai soup dumplings, shrimp hargow, vegetable steamed dumplings, pan akaushi beef potstickers,  sesame chicken, and the salt and pepper tofu.

Dim Sum:
The Shanghai soup dumplings tasted delicious and creamy with just the right amount of soup and were my favorite.  The shrimp hargow was plump and had a huge shrimp. The pan akaushi came nicely decorated. The steamed vegetable dumplings were my least favorite. They tasted very strong of something earthy and bitter. I do not recommend getting them.

Other Food:
The sesame chicken was good but tasted more generic. The salt and pepper tofu were pretty good, but I wish the outside were more crispy.

Overall, the ambiance is nice, and the food is good with superb service.","Food - Shanghai Soup Dumplings (Delicious and creamy), Shrimp Hargow (Plump with a huge shrimp), Pan Akaushi Beef Potstickers (Nicely decorated), Sesame Chicken (Good but generic), Salt and Pepper Tofu (Pretty good, could be crispier)||Ambiance - Beautiful mix of modern and traditional décor||Service - Phenomenal, attentive "
Qi Austin,"Me and my boyfriend came here for Friday night for date night and we had an amazing time!! We got the Shanghai soup dumplings, the caviar Shumai, pork belly, bok choy with shiitake mushrooms, and the spicy sesame chicken. We liked everything we got but our favorites were the shumai and the pork belly bc of how flavorful and juicy/tender they were!! They are known for their Shanghai soup dumplings but they were kinda eh to me just bc they tasted kinda frozen. We were so stuffed at the end and it was fun sharing everything family style.

Qi Austin,"Amazing dim sum and great service! On the pricier side, but one of the best dim sum places I've been to all year.. Fresh ingredients, a dash of fusion, piping hot when it comes out, with more that I haven't tried yet.

Crab meat fish maw soup couplings - skin is on the thicker side, filling juicy and tender. Only complaint I have was that they didn't give me a soup spoon or extra bowls to eat this without spilling the juice.

Pork and shrimp sui mai - very fresh with good consistency.

Scallop caviar siu mai - amazingly good! 3 for $15 is a bit higher than the 5 for $12 normal siu mai, but flavor, texture (it was all mixed together, and not a normal siu mai with a scallop on top), juiciness exceeded my expectations. This siu mai was one of the best Ive had.

Scallion pancake curry dip - I like the concept and the strong onion flavor in the pancake, but I don't think the concept was executed very well. The pancake is on the smaller size and the curry is more liquid, so dipping it is very light, vs what you might get in a burmese paratha with coconut curry dip.

Crispy chicken turnover - They look like little mice, with the outsides having a mochi consistency and insides being on the salty savory side. Really well done and highly recommended!

Shrimp stuffed chinese eggplant - This was more of a shrimp on top of an eggplant.. Shrimp was very tender with good flavor. I liked the overall consistency of the dish, but would recommend giving it a min to cool down before starting.

Egg custard tart - very well executed with nice flavor, and extra flaky crust. It was more on the yellow side, and I personally would have preferred a little bit of a burn on the top.

The one dish I would not recommend is the stir fried potato glass noodle. For $19 its on the larger side, and its 100% carbs, so good value, but on the drier side and way too much to eat.","Food - Crab Meat Fish Maw Soup Dumplings (thick skin, juicy and tender filling), Pork and Shrimp Sui Mai (very fresh, good consistency), Scallion Pancake Curry Dip (concept liked, execution lacking), Crispy Chicken Turnover (well done, highly recommended), Shrimp Stuffed Chinese Eggplant (shrimp tender, good flavor), Egg Custard Tart (well executed, nice flavor, extra flaky crust), Stir Fried Potato Glass Noodle (on the drier side, too much to eat)||Service - Great||Price - high "
Qi Austin,"Dinner in the city with my family...
We came for the dim sum...well no...I came for the dim sum and they came for the noodles.
I wasn't impressed with the food but the ambiance and service was impeccable. Idk...it's kinda hard judging Asian cuisine in the states when you're born and raised in Okinawa, so I don't want to be too picky.. but the main complaint was that all the noodle dishes we ordered was just too greasy. The food was fresh and had good flavors. cool place to catch up with friends for apps n drinks but no more big dinners here for us.

Qi Austin,"Delicious Dim Sum with great attention to detail and an inviting modern setting.

This is a great spot to enjoy dim sum that is mostly authentic, but also very approachable, whether for a date or a party.  The space is well appointed and comfortable -- with staff that are zippy, friendly, and welcoming.

The Dim Sum selection is very good, encompassing a large variety that will satisfy those seeking more authentic items and preparations.  It does not pander to cliches of Western expectations of Chinese food, but highlights Chinese cuisine in a manner that is generally authentic but also approachable with a high regard for detail.  Dim Sum staples are all really well executed -- from Shrimp Har Gow, Pork Shu Mai, to Egg Tarts (too many to name).  The rock stars of various types of buns including the soup dumpling are well executed.  Many typically traditional items such as Pea Shoots for a vegetable entree or Chicken Feet dim sum were cool to see as options.

A lot of what's on offer are interpretations that are up-leveled for concept, which they do very well.  The presentation of many items were very memorable, some admittedly were too aesthetically perfect to eat (specifically an item that was formed into the most adorable mice).  Finally, however, some items that are nice to see on the menu, deviate a bit too much from traditional expectations (specifically the Zar Zhang Noodles).

Overall a standout for Dim Dum and Chinese cuisine in Austin.  Excellent!","Food - Dim Sum (mostly authentic, large variety), Modern setting||Service - Zippy, friendly, welcoming||Ambiance - Inviting "
Qi Austin,"Qi is my favorite place to get dim sum, or just fancy Chinese food, in general! Today, I had a big dinner with my mom and ordered:

o. steam lobster dumplings
o. scallop caviar sui mai dumplings
o. shrimp har gaw
o. crab meat corn soup
o. crispy whole fish
o. truffle egg fried rice

Of the three dumplings (and others that I've tried before), our favorite was the shrimp har gaw. Along with that, the crab meat corn soup is something we always order --and one bowl is definitely big enough of an appetizer to share between two people! Crispy whole fish and the truffle egg fried rice were two items that we ordered for the first time today, but both did not disappoint! The fish was lightly fried and covered in delicious sweet sauce, and was definitely big enough for 3+ people. The menu is at market price, and we paid $70, which I found to be pretty reasonable. Although both of us thought that the fish would go well with just a simple, white rice, the truffle egg fried rice was another great menu. It was super flavorful, and paired well with chili oil. They will definitely be a part of our staple items at Qi!","Food - Steam Lobster Dumplings (good), Scallop Caviar Sui Mai Dumplings (good), Shrimp Har Gaw (favorite), Crab Meat Corn Soup (large portion), Crispy Whole Fish (lightly fried, delicious sweet sauce, large portion), Truffle Egg Fried Rice (did not disappoint)||Price - Reasonable "
Qi Austin,"What I love about this place, not only has a great ambience, cocktails, or solid, and food is flavorful. Please get the lychee martini, and watermelon, tequila cocktail, but replace it with Mezcal, it elevates the cocktail with the smokiness. Trust me.

Whether it's for date night, or a family meal, this place has the right flavors for you. Great appetizers with some soup dumplings, and wide selection of entrÃ©es (definitely recommend the truffle fried rice). The truffle fried rice is perfectly seasoned, fluffy, flavorful and just melts in your mouth. We came here last minute, sat at the bar and they were able to accommodate us within 15 minutes.

Qi Austin,"The food here is amazing and well worth the price.

Arrived here on a Friday night at 6 pm. I could have made reservations prior but I didn't know if I would be craving dim sum at the time so decided to wing it.

Well I was, and me and my girlfriend were not disappointed with the food.

The Shanghai sound dumplings arrived with better presentation than I would expect for soup dumplings. The broth was rich and complimented the soft ground pork inside the dumpling.

I decided I was in AUSTIN TX and wanted to try something different, and got the alligator nuggets. It was like chicken but not tiring. Almost as if the fat was embedded into the fibers to keep it from becoming dry. My girlfriend didn't shut up about alligator tasting so good so that's how I knew the food had made the top of the list.

The truffle rice was amazing. I dont usually expect much from rice. It even Had a thinly sliced piece of truffle on top. My mouth watered. I didn't care for the noodles I ordered but what's a meal without noodles?  

I'm glad we took a chance and came here despite almost being turned away from a fully booked restaurant. When we arrived they looked at us crazy for not having reservations. We sat at the countertops watching the cooks make the dumplings. After an hour and ten minutes of eating, the restaurant was still half empty. Maybe confirm your reservations before immediately offering us the counters.  

The inside was nice, hell I even took photos of the bathroom because the toilet seat would automatically open.

The dim sum selections were fantastic and all super tasty. I enjoyed the pan-fried dumplings, which came with an extra crispy bit on the bottom, which was perfect. Their Peking duck was also quite delicious; however, each order only came with 3 bao which is not enough for all the duck! The desserts had their unique twist and were a great way to close out an amazing dinner.

Undoubtedly, this is on the expensive side of Asian food, and the portions are on the small side. However, I do highly recommend Qi, and I will be here again for amazing dim sum!","Food - Dim Sum (Fantastic, super tasty), Pan-fried Dumplings (Extra crispy bottom, perfect), Peking Duck (Delicious, small portions), Desserts (Unique twist)||Price - Expensive, small portions||Service - Great "
Qi Austin,"Upscale dim-sum restaurant in the heart of downtown Austin, enjoyed dinner here on a weeknight and it was pretty good -- got the vegetables in taro bird nest and was impressed with the assortment of veggies and freshness. The tea and drinks are delicious too, but the dessert takes the prize! Really decadent with interesting flavors and so instagrammable, would go here just for drinks and dessert!

Qi Austin,"Beautiful restaurant. Sat at the bar. The bartender was very helpful and honest. They helped me pick what to eat and what drinks to get. The staff checks on you and gives you instructions on how to get the full experience of what you eat and drink. The portions are good as well. I had the Shanghai Soup Dumplings and the Honey Akaushi Beef with Jasmine Rice. For drinks, I had the Tingling Electric Daisy and the Tokyo Pear. The Tingling Electric Daisy is such a cool experience that leaves your tongue tingling (hence the name). I loved everything. Will definitely come back in the future.","Food - Shanghai Soup Dumplings (good), Honey Akaushi Beef with Jasmine Rice (good)||Drinks - Tingling Electric Daisy (cool experience, leaves tongue tingling), Tokyo Pear(loved)||Service - Helpful, honest, checks on customers, provides instructions||Bar - Beautiful "

Qi Austin,"For what it is, I think Qi is a decent Chinese restaurant in downtown Austin, and people should give it a try. Although not as good as other Asian restaurants in other states, they do have some unique and bold way of delivering their dim sum dishes.

The interior of the restaurant is beautiful: full of decor, especially the framed art! Did I forget to mention their bathroom has an automatic closing and opening lid? Lol I've digressed.

I would 100% recommend their hargow (shrimp dumplings). The texture is right for the flour, and the shrimp is nice and crunchy! The sticky rice is also good, and I've never seen it in a braided banana leaf like that. It's a little impractical and over the top, but at least it was aesthetically pleasing! The Peking duck is decent and affordable, and would give it a try if you've never had crispy duck skin before.

I would not recommend the xiaolongbao (soup dumplings). The dumpling was very mushy, and the filling was too sweet for my liking. I also did not like the egg bun. It was over cooked, and lacked the runny egg custard.","Food - Hargow (crunchy), Sticky rice (good), Peking duck (decent, affordable), Xiaolongbao (mushy, too sweet), Egg bun (overcooked, lacked runny egg custard)||Ambiance - Beautiful, full of decor, framed art||Service - Decent "
Qi Austin,"This is the 3rd location we've been to of the Lin Asian restaurants and all of them have been very delicious. The dim sum soup dumplings are out of this world! For entrees, we had the salmon, pork belly, beef and truffle rice. The standout of the night was the salmon, but they were all tasty! I did not particularly enjoy the desserts. We had the green tea mouse and ice cream with a biscuit shell. They were just ok, I've had much better at other Asian restaurants. The service was great and the restaurant is very upscale.","Food - Dim Sum Soup Dumplings (out of this world), Salmon (standout), Pork Belly (tasty), Beef and Truffle Rice (tasty), Green Tea Mousse and Ice Cream with a Biscuit Shell (just ok)||Service - Great||Ambiance - Upscale "
Qi Austin,"After 6 or more visits and ordering most of the menu, I can say that this place never disappoints!

Service - Kris & Alex are our go to servers and they are friendly, knowledgeable about the menu and competent servers.

Food- The menu is not as large as a casual dining Chinese restaurant (and this is upscale) but it has just about every protein normally found that you could want: beef, chicken, pork, duck, alligator and fish....tofu also. We've had most of the menu and it is all fantastic!
They also have an exceptionally good wine selection.

Our favorites is the pork soup dumplings. Served in all of Lin's restaurants and not to be missed.

The ambiance is warm, slightly dim and well appointed. There really isn't anything to not like about this place! It is definitely a favorite of ours!","Food - Pork Soup Dumplings (fantastic)||Service - Friendly, Knowledgeable||Ambiance - Warm, well-appointed||Drinks - Good Wine Selection "
Qi Austin,"I can't believe I have not left a key review before now! this place is fantastic! First of all, they have a great list of dim sum that is offered all of the time. They are probably best known for their Shanghai soup dumplings and I concur! Although, everything we have tried on the dim sum menu has been noteworthy. The weekend dim sum brunch menu is off the charts!!

The entrÃ©e menu, is not excessively long like many Asian restaurants, yet has every kind of protein that you can want, as well as some vegetarian options. Duck, pork, lobster, crab, shrimp, Akaushi beef, chicken, fish....see my point?!

Dessert is also incredible and dessert is not my thing. Too many to list but there is something that will grab you.

Oh, I almost forgot one of the best parts! They usually have a featured bottle of wine, that is a really good bottle, for up to 50% off on occasion. Last week, it was just 30% off but it was absolutely worth it. They have my favorite wine list of all Asian restaurants in Austin.

AND they have free parking in the attached garage! In downtown Austin! What??!!

Qi Austin,"I came here mostly for the dining experience and to bond with friends. It's situated in a nice spot on West 6th, and the free garage parking is a HUGE perk being in that area. No need to circle the blocks 20x looking for street parking!

The food is pretty decent & flavorful, however, as a Chinese person who tends to frequent dim sum restaurants in Chinatown Houston when craving such, I knew the restaurant was catering to a specific crowd when setting it's price point/serving portions.

Our server, the cocktails, and the ambience were great though!

Qi Austin,"On a quick trip to Austin, this place was lively on a Sunday night. For a group of 3 at 7:30pm, we were sat immediately at a table outside under some fan/misting.

Food was delicious:
- the Shanghai soup dumplings were hot and unique in that the filling was soft and homogenous rather than a lump of meat sitting in a pool of liquid
- Zha Jiang noodles were a touch spicy that made it flavorful and tasty
- Honey Akaushi Beef was delicious with great soft texture and crunchy fresh onions in a sweet glaze
- Baby Bok Choi was fresh and crunchy with yummy shiitake mushrooms and came beautifully presented

The ambiance was classy with thoughtful touches and nods to Asian culture around. The outdoor patio was on a relatively busy street, but didn't diminish the ambiance much.

Service was prompt and friendly, and food came out quickly!

Our only gripe was the price tag. While the food was delicious, we weren't sure that the few pieces of beef garnered a $29 tag, nor the XLB/soup dumplings $3 each. Understandably, it's presenting itself as finer dining in an expensive-to-rent area, so we definitely think it's worth trying if you're willing to splurge!","Food - Shanghai Soup Dumplings (delicious, hot and unique with a soft filling), Zha Jiang Noodles (spicy, flavorful and tasty), Honey Akaushi Beef (delicious with soft texture and crunchy fresh onions in a sweet glaze), Baby Bok Choi (fresh and crunchy, beautifully presented)||Ambiance - Classy with thoughtful Asian cultural touches||Price - high "
Qi Austin,"Incredible experience. Hands down best Shanghai Soup Dumplings I've ever had. Everything about their flavor and texture and broth was addictive. I'd love to try the crabmeat ones as well next time. We also had the pan fried beef bao, which had an amazingly soft bun with a light and perfect crisp to the outside. We ordered the crispy pecan shrimp entre, which was also delicious, although I wish we'd had more people to split it with since it was gluttonous to eat so much sweet fried stuff. We finished off with the chocolate filled bao, which was tasty although next time I'll use my stomach space on more soup dumplings

Our waiter was super friendly and welcoming, and the overall atmosphere was great.

Qi Austin,"By no means is a three-star review a negative. If someone wanted to come eat here, I wouldn't deter them. It's just that Qi is not for me. Qi fills a specific niche (elevated Asian-inspired) which I don't often crave.

Overall, the food here was fine but I probably wouldn't choose to come back since parking isn't ""easy"" and the meal wasn't really worth the price (to me). On the plus side, the ambiance was great, drink options were unique, and the menu offered some fun and diverse options. I'm glad to see them have success but it's just not for me.

Qi Austin,"I've been eyeing Qi for quite some time now, and finally had the opportunity to celebrate my one year anniversary with my husband on 10/16/22.

Ambience - Great atmosphere with Asian decor, and wine cellars throughout the restaurant.  The restaurant is on the smaller side, however they also have outdoor seating too.  Nonetheless, it's the perfect place for date night, girls night out, dinner with family, etc.

Service - As soon as we entered the restaurant we were greeted and seated immediately which was great!  I didn't get the name of our waitress, but she was great to work with and super friendly. She made a few recommendations on the food, suggested a red blend wine which we loved and gave us complimentary dessert for our anniversary as well.  She also checked up on us frequently which I really appreciated.

Food - everything we ordered was fantastic!  We ordered:

Crab Meat Fish Soup Dumplings
Lobster Dumplings
Truffle Egg Fried Rice
Shrimp Stuffed Eggplant
Shrimp Har Kaw
Pork & Shrimp Shu mai
Cilantro Shrimp Dumpling
Fried Snapper with Sweet & Sour sauce

I also wanted to note their 3 dipping sauces for the dim sum, their chili sauce was my favorite!  It has a bit of sweetness to it which I loved!

Pricing - A bit on the higher end, but for the quality of the food, it's well worth paying.  

Parking - Free garage parking.  Just be on the lookout for signage as some of the spots are reserved

Qi Austin,"I recently had the opportunity to dine at Qi, and it turned out to be a pleasant culinary experience. While it might not have been a mind-blowing revelation, there were certainly aspects of the meal that left a positive impression.

Qi's ambiance is comfortable and inviting. The restaurant's interior is tastefully decorated with subtle Chinese motifs, creating a relaxed and cozy atmosphere. It's an ideal spot for a casual dinner with friends or family.

Now, onto the food. Qi offers a broad range of classic Chinese dishes, and the menu has something to suit various tastes. The highlights for me included the General Tso's Chicken, which had a nice balance of sweet and savory flavors, and the vegetable dumplings, which were delightfully fresh and accompanied by a tasty dipping sauce. The hot and sour soup was another winner, with a satisfying blend of tanginess and spiciness.","Food - General Tso's Chicken (nice balance of sweet and savory flavors), Vegetable Dumplings (fresh with tasty dipping sauce), Hot and Sour Soup (satisfying blend of tanginess and spiciness)||Ambiance - Comfortable and inviting, tastefully decorated interior||Service - Comprehensive "

Qi Austin,"Found out about this place from a story on someone's IG. Thought the food presentation and decor looked really good, but that's all it is. Looks. Service wasn't the best. Our server wasn't personable, he actually seemed miserable being there. He took long and didn't really talk unless he had to.

Food presentation was nice and it sounded good on the menu.  Lobster dumpling, scallop caviar siu mai, it sounds good right? No, it wasn't good. It was terrible! I felt so bad because it was my idea to go there and the food is kind of pricey. I couldn't finish the food, I didn't enjoy it at all. The only food I decently liked was the egg drop soup and fried rice. But how can you mess those two foods up. I guess it's a place to try if you want to see the pretty decor and take some foodie pics, but that's it. I have no interest coming back.","Food - Lobster Dumpling (terrible), Scallop Caviar Siu Mai (terrible), Egg Drop Soup (decent), Fried Rice (decent)||Service - Not personable, Seemed miserable, Didn't talk||Ambiance - Good décor||Price - high "
Qi Austin,"Oh, this place rocks!! The dim sum is excellent, high quality and very nicely done. Some of the items are slightly fusion and adapted to this area and culture, but the quality and the workmanship put into the dim sum with spectacular presentation is well worth the extra cost. I'm from the San Francisco area and I am Asian so I know good dim sum.

All the ingredients are so fresh and they use locally sourced produce from a local farm when possible. We went there for dinner and it was so good and we were so impressed that we came back the next morning for dim sum! For dinner we had the bok choy with shiitake mushrooms, excellent with a subtle sauce on it. We also had the seafood curry which was chock-full of different types of seafood in it, they were very generous. Between dinner in the evening and dim sum the next morning, we had many of their dishes but I will just comment on some of the stand outs. For dim sum, their shrimp stuffed Chinese eggplant was so plump and delicious. Their crispy chicken turnovers were shaped like cute little mice, so fun to eat and delicious too! The salt and pepper shrimp was excellent, nice subtle flavors. Their cilantro shrimp dumplings and basil chicken dumplings were so satisfying and flavorful. We loved the Shanghai soup dumplings, round and plump with hearty broth inside. Their desserts are amazing and excellent, be sure to try one!

The service is immaculate, friendly and helpful and very efficient. The manager is a very good manager.  One thing fun about the place is that they have automatic toilets with motion sensors.

Qi Austin,"There are very few Asian restaurants in Austin that has the authentic feel, taste and charm making you feel as if you are actually dining in another country like Qi. The decor is very contemporary, but still made you feel as if you were walking the streets of Shanghai. I am a huge fan of Lin's dim sum and now, I can add Qi to my list. We started with the Shanghai soup dumplings, lobster dumplings and chicken taro egg rolls.
The special of the evening was a salt and pepper whole lobster, but we were disappointed to find out that at 7:30 in the evening, they were completely out! However, we were soon relieved when we were told that they still had the salt and pepper lobster tails available. We ordered those in addition to the honey beef and the truffle egg fried rice. We enjoyed all of our dishes, several bottles of sake, as well as the service we received from Kriselda.","Food - Shanghai Soup Dumplings (enjoyed), Lobster Dumplings (enjoyed), Chicken Taro Egg Rolls (enjoyed), Salt and Pepper Lobster Tails (enjoyed), Honey Beef and Truffle Egg Fried Rice (enjoyed)||Ambiance - Contemporary decor||Service - Impressive "
Qi Austin,"After trying Lin, we had to try the sister restaurant Qi. Located near Whole Foods downtown and not to far from Lin. They have their own garage so parking was easy.

We decided to try our luck again and did a walk-in. Would definitely recommend you make reservations though. After a small wait we were seated at the bar.  The place had beauty decorations everywhere from lanterns and umbrellas to robes and glass sculptures.  One thing that stood out to me was the signed bottle of wine near the front of the entrance. Pro Football Hall of Famer Tony Gonzalez!

Our Baristas were Minh and ""Rabbit"". Not sure if they were just playing with us since it's the year of the Rabbit/Cat, but it was funny. They had a special Lunar new year drink menu. Tried both the Red Envelope and the Jade Rabbit. Both were beautiful and delicious and had gold flakes. We also tried a couple normal menu drinks Watermelon Cooler and Honey Cider. Both were very refreshing.

For appetizers we ordered the Crab Meat Corn Soup and Scallop Caviar Sui Mai Dumplings. The soup rich and the Crab delicious. The dumplings were delightful. They looked so good, I didn't give them a little time to cool before gobbling them up.

Both our entrees were beef protein. The Honey Akaushi Beef and Rainbow Akaushi Beef were cooked beautifully. They both had a nice crispy sear on the beef and flavorful sauce.

After trying Lin, Qi did not disappoint. Fun servers and delicious food is always a great combination. Two thumbs up!","Food - Crab Meat Corn Soup (rich, delicious), Scallop Caviar Sui Mai Dumplings (delightful), Honey Akaushi Beef (crispy, flavorful sauce), Rainbow Akaushi Beef (crispy, flavorful sauce)||Drinks - Red Envelope (beautiful, delicious), Jade Rabbit(beautiful, delicious), Watermelon Cooler (refreshing), Honey Cider (refreshing)||Ambiance - Beautiful decor||Parking - Easy||Service - Fun "
Qi Austin,"Qi is one of my all time favorite restaurants in Austin! The best way to describe is exquisite dim sum and chinese cuisine. As a sister restaurant to Lin's, Qi has the famous soup dumplings that in my opinion make this place worth visiting.

I have not yet encountered any other establishment that has great soup dumplings that are comparable to Qi/Lin's. Other items that I liked to get at the scallop caviar Sui mai, honey sesame chicken, and occasionally the har gow.

If you are used to normal traditional Chinese dim sum establishments, do NOT expect the same experience here. Expect to pay higher prices and receive good service. If you are looking for a large variety of dim sum items, I would look elsewhere in Austin. During lunch and dinner, the dim sum menu is not as expansive.

I would say this makes for a great spot to meet with friends or go on a date. I'm hoping they will open a restaurant in Houston!","Food - Soup dumplings (exquisite), scallop caviar Sui mai (liked), honey sesame chicken (liked), har gow (liked),||Price - High||Service - Good||Ambiance - Great "
Qi Austin,"The best dimsum in Austin hands down. The atmosphere reminds of of some famous dumsum places in SF. Everything tasted authentic and there was plenty of options to pick from. They add a little special touch to each traditional dimsum item, whether it be presentation or extra ingredients. I honestly think you can order just about anything here and be satisfied. The only thing I would avoid is the zhajianmein. The thing I would recommend the most is the deserts if you love matcha.

Qi Austin,"Came here for my daughters birthday last night. We get to our table and the waiter is on us immediately. We need a sec so he comes back again in about a minute. My wife orders a drink off their drinks menu, I order a captain & coke, daughter orders a Shirley temple. My wife's drink and the Shirley temple show up, we put in our order. No drink for me. 10 minutes later still no drink for me. So I get his attention and he comes over and before I can say where's my drink he says ""oh we don't have captain Morgan.""... like 10 minutes went by and he didn't bother to tell me they couldn't make my drink...so I order a Bacardi and coke. This time it only took a few minutes for him to say they didn't have Bacardi.  At this point I'm annoyed so I make do with water for the night.

The food. Generally pretty good. The soup dumplings were just ""ok.""  Not much there flavor wise. The beef dumplings were also just ok. But the shrimp dumplings (har gow?) were fantastic, as was the duck. Fried rice and sesame chicken were fine.

So, back to all the fun we had with the waiter. Now that's it's busier he's nowhere to be found. Woulda been great to have some of that food with some water...

So after dinner we mention that it's my daughters birthday. He brings out some ice cream and a candle which is great.

We get the bill, and to my disbelief he's charged for BOTH drinks that I didn't get, and also for the desert that we didn't order. Fortunately there was no argument about taking the drinks and desert off the bill.

So I guess the moral of this story is only order drinks off their drink menu, and check your bill.

Oh, they also forgot the baby bok choy we ordered (didn't even make its way into the bill).","Food - Soup Dumplings (Ok), Beef Dumplings (Ok), Shrimp Dumplings (Fantastic), Duck (Fantastic), Fried Rice (Fine), Sesame Chicken (Fine)||Service - Missing drinks, forgot orders, no attention||Ambiance - Nice "

I would say the actual food is pretty mediocre and you're better off finding a local run restaurant that's more affordable instead. I got the spicy chicken and while it was good...there was nothing remarkable about it.

Qi Austin,"Qi is Lin's sister that is just a bit closer to down with a better parking situation. We walked in on a busy weekend, grabbed a drink, and waited with fingers crossed that we would get a seat at the well appointed bar. Success! (I definitely recommend making resos.)
We tried all of the Lunar New Year special cocktails. They were beautifully crafted and served by witty and cheerful bartenders. The wine list is impressive!
But the true stars lie on the pages of the food menu.
We started with crab corn soup. It was somehow both light and hardy. The velvety broth was dotted with ample protein, yet the corn was perfectly highlighted.
Next came the scallop caviar shu mai. What a treat. We could not resist the aroma and gobbled the steamy sea pillows. We could have stopped there, but the beef dishes called out. Both the pepper beef and honey beef were beautifully seasoned and seared. The honey beef was a bit overly honeyed for me. Also, I asked to make it spicy, but it was not. It was still delicious, but I preferred the pepper beef.

All in all, Qi is a must when looking for passionately chef-driven Asian cuisine in Austin. But once you eat at Lin, I just don't know if I can give another restaurant 5 stars! If I could give 4.9 though, I would!","Food - Crab Corn Soup (light and hardy, Velvety broth, Dotted with ample protein, Perfectly highlighted corn), Scallop Caviar Shu Mai (treat), Pepper Beef (beautifully seasoned and seared), Honey Beef (beautifully seasoned and seared, Bit overly honeyed)||Drinks - Lunar New Year special cocktails||Service - Witty and cheerful bartenders||Parking - Better than Lin||Ambiance - Well-appointed bar "
Qi Austin,"I'm not usually a fan of Fusion chinese food, but this is definitely fusion done right.

Highly recommend the salt and pepper tofu. It sounds plain but trust me it's very crispy and the salt and pepper were perfect to taste",Food - Salt and pepper tofu||Menu - Huge 
Qi Austin,"WOW, delicious!
I came for a friend's birthday dinner and they provided a great large table in the corner that gave us some privacy.
The server was very patient, consistent, helpful. This was the first time for everyone in the group and he gave great recommendations. We, of course, got the soup dumplings, a few appetizers, and shared a few entrees.
I was VERY impressed by the shrimp entree. It was so tasty, flavorful, and filling! Definitely a unique dish that I would ABSOLUTELY come back to get again.","Food - Soup Dumplings (great), Appetizers (impressive), Shrimp Entree (tasty, flavorful, filling), Menu - Huge "
Qi Austin,"Here's the thing - if you're more of an eater for value, it'll hurt ordering food at this location. I never seen 2 tiny lotus wraps cost over 12 dollars in my entire life.

However, if you are in it more for the experience and atmosphere of the restaurant, this is your place. The restaurant is gorgeous, large wine selection, and presentation is exceptional. If this is what your aim is, this could easily be considered a 4 or 5 star experience.

The dim sum taste itself was pretty on par with what you'd expect and after factoring the price, brings my score to what it is. You could eat double the amount of just as good tasting dim sum for the same price and most locations.","Food - Dim Sum (Par, large price), Wine (large selection)||Ambiance - Gorgeous||Service - Exceptional||Price - high "
Qi Austin,"I tried Lin a few months back, which is owned by the same people, so my expectations were not very high for Qi. I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed Qi so much more! It's beautiful inside, came here during December and the restaurant was very tastefully decorated festively.There is also free parking in the same building on level P4.

We tried a variety of things from the dim sum menu: Scallop Caviar Sui Mai, SautÃ©ed Baby Bok Choy, SautÃ©ed Water Spinach, Dan Dan Noodle, Scallion Pancake Curry Dip, Shrimp Har Kaw, Pork and Shrimp Sui Mai, Steam BBQ Pork Bun, Shanghai Soup Dumpling. I would pass on the SautÃ©ed Baby Bok Choy and Steam BBQ Pork Bun. My favorites were the SautÃ©ed Water Spinach, Shrimp Har Kaw, and Pork and Shrimp Sui Mai. The one thing we got from the main menu was the truffle fried rice. This was okay but nothing special, was way more impressed with the dim sum.","Food - Scallop Caviar Sui Mai (impressive), Sauted Baby Bok Choy (pass), Sauted Water Spinach (favorite), Dan Dan Noodle (impressive), Scallion Pancake Curry Dip (impressive), Shrimp Har Kaw (favorite), Pork and Shrimp Sui Mai (favorite), Steam BBQ Pork Bun (pass), Shanghai Soup Dumpling (pass), truffle fried rice (okay), dim sum menu - Sauted Baby Bok Choy (pass), Steam BBQ Pork Bun (pass)||Ambiance - Beautiful, festively decorated||Parking - Free||Service - Impressive "

Qi Austin,"Fusion restaurant located in the west downtown area.

Those of you craving traditional dim sum, you are about to be disappointed if that's your expectation. The menu is a creative fusion between American and pan-Asian--predominantly Chinese--dishes. If one were to rate this place based on its representation of more traditional dim sum, it would probably get only 2 stars.

Alright! Now that we got that controversy out of the way, judging this establishment based purely on the quality of the food it serves, the experience, and the value, I'd give it 4 stars. Each of the dishes I've had here have generally been quite good, with nothing that stood out as anything altogether bad. If you have a xiao long bao craving, this place will work for you in a pinch. I feel guilty saying this, but one of my favorite dishes here in the past was the gator with Sichuan seasoning (see, I told you this was a fusion restaurant). This dish has a nice amount of numbing spice to it, and I can imagine that some people who aren't used to consuming numbing spice probably wouldn't be a fan (but I personally am). The cocktails here are also pretty solid and worth trying as well.","Food - Gator with Sichuan seasoning (liked, numbing spice), Dim Sum (Asian-American fusion, not traditional)||Drinks - Solid cocktails||Service - Great "

Qi Austin,Cocktails and food were amazing and the restaurant is so cute. Our favorites were the truffle egg fried rice and pork soup dumplings.,Food was very flavorful and I will definitely be back! [/INST]
Qi Austin,"Just WOW. A lot of family in town so we decided to gather here and what a smart choice that was! We were quite a large party and they were able to accommodate us on their patio area. Hosts of the dinner ordered an array of foods for the table and we were not disappointed. My favorites were the juicy dumplings, chicken, and the truffle rice. I could eat that truffle rice everyday for every meal for the rest of my life.

Qi Austin,"It's hard to continually knock companies in this day and age for service issues. I know getting quality employees might be the biggest challenge in all service industries. So I'll try and set slightly slow, slightly seemingly disinterested server issues aside...

The food was great. The ambiance was great. The drinks were exceptionally creative and impressive. Portions were slightly on the small side, but maybe I just wanted more of what we didn't take home!

Qi Austin,"LOVED our experience here! We sat outside on the patio with our dog. We tried Shanghai soup dumplings (not as flavorful as I remember their sister restaurant's offering (Lin Asian); Chicken with cashew Dumplings (VERY tasty!); Steamed vegetable dumplings (good but could use more flavors);
Sesame Balls for dessert (always a favorite of mine!)

BUT what STOLE THE SHOW was the Crispy Chicken Turnovers. I don't know why I picked this one, but SO GLAD I DID! It looked NOTHING like what I expected. I've added a photo.. 3 MICE came to the table!  Noodle tails & almond slice ears! SO CUTE!!

Apparently whoever owns this restaurant & Lin Asian employ ARTISTS!  :)

Qi Austin,"Highly recommend this place. Everything we tried had a great presentation and flavor. The bird's nest was crunchy and had such a great, light flavor. The noodles were nice and spicy, the ox tail was yummy, and the dumplings were cute and delicious! The dessert topped it all. I'm not the biggest beets fan but the combination of the lemon underneath of the sorbet made me an instant fan. I hope to return soon and try some more dishes. The price was great for the quality and amount of food we ordered. Definitely make reservations and try it out.","Food - Bird Nest (crunchy with great flavor), Noodles (nice and spicy), Ox Tail (yummy), Dumplings (cute and delicious), Dessert (topped it all, Beets sorbet (not good but combination with lemon underneath made it an instant favorite)||Price - Great||Service - Friendly and attentive||Location - Great||Ambiance - Cozy and inviting "
Qi Austin,"First I have to inform that the restaurant has free parking in the adjacent garage. I say that because I didn't know and paid for parking on the street. It's great that they offer it.
That said, the restaurant is beautiful , the food and service are excellent. There are enough vegetarian options. I was informed by the waitstaff that they serve family style, however, although my halibut was delicious, it was truly a single portion and nothing added to it either. I guess for $34, I might have liked a little something more. Anyway, it was tasty . The truffle fried rice was great and a good portion. The vegetable dumplings as appetizers was a beautiful presentation and delicious!
My cocktail was good also. Seemed like there were people who are regulars or at least come often as they hugged the maitra d/ Sonny, when they left which was nice to see he had nice relationships with the patrons. There is outdoor seating .
The restaurant is attached to a note and it is on Sixth street, where there are lots of bars/ lounges/ and restaurants . It's a happening area.
The Asian fusion food was good and if I lived in Austin, I would return and recommend.","Food - Halibut (delicious but small portion), Truffle fried rice (great portion), Vegetable dumplings (beautiful presentation, delicious)||Parking - Free||Service - Excellent||Ambiance - Beautiful "
Qi Austin,"The waiting in line was very awkward as no one acknowledged us and the staff kept walking around us until I went up to a person and asked them who the host was. We were seated promptly as we had a reservation.

The food was good but the service was pretty bad given we had to flag someone down and try to get their attention.

The duck was exceptional but could serve more than two pancakes with half a duck! (You can order more for an up charge)

The soup dumplings were decent - they didn't give us spoons for them, had to ask for that as well.","Food - Duck (exceptional), Soup Dumplings (decent)||Service - Bad||Ambiance - Awkward "

Qi Austin,"The thing about dim sum in Austin is that during the week. It's limited menu however
From the limited menu
Everything was delicious
And everything was handmade
Even my picky son was eating with us
The truffle fried rice was basic but still delicious simple yet delicious

A little side note on the restaurant. It's very high tech and modern
I was even more blown away when I went to the bathroom
Before going on our 3 hour drive to Houston!
The bathroom has a bidet, seat is warm, self flush, self re-flushes until everything is done and clean

Qi Austin,"Thoroughly enjoyed our dim sum brunch here with a couple friends.  I made a reservation a couple weeks in advance and glad I did as it was busy when we walked in.

Parking is free in the commercial garage that the restaurant is located in.  The garage is pretty much empty on weekends so parking and taking the elevator down was a breeze.

We ordered a slew of dim sum plates but our favorites were the lobster dumplings and the soup dumplings.  The host at the front and our server were both friendly and timely.","Food - Lobster Dumplings (Thoroughly Enjoyed), Soup Dumplings (Thoroughly Enjoyed)||Service - Friendly and Timely||Parking - Free||Location - Commercial Garage||Garage - Empty on Weekends "

Qi Austin,"Somebody PLEASE stop me from coming back to this place so often. Every time I visit, I have such a wonderful experience that I keep coming back.

Their truffle egg fried rice has. me. in. a. chokehold. It looks underwhelming on the outside but boy, does it pack so much flavor. I get it every time I visit along with the Shanghai soup dumplings.

I adventured a little last time and tried their alligator, pea shoots, spare ribs, and eggplant dish and found them all so flavorful and delicious. Qi never misses!

Although it's a pretty pricey place, I think their dishes and service are worth every penny.

The food, the service, the decor, the ambiance, the experience - could not be better in any way.

The interior is very well decorated, feels like I'm in a fancy Chinese tea house.
The service is extremely attentive, our waitress visited our table at least 6 times.

The food, oh my gosh.
Being a pescatarian, I really missed dimsum as most dishes are meat, but Qi is like pescatarian heaven.
We got the Crab Soup Dumplings - will definitely be coming back for these. The meat inside is so soft and the soup is delicious. Every bite was amazing.
The Lobster Dumplings were so cute. Like little bunnies. I thought they were well prepared and the wrapper was a great chewy texture.
The Scallop Caviar Sui Mai was very decadent. The caviar were like fish flavored popping boba.
The Pecan Shrimp was my favorite dish. The shrimp was fried but still so crisp on the inside. The pecan and apple were the perfect compliment to the shrimp. The sauce was light but rich.

Came for my birthday and we got a hedgehog for dessert, so cute!! It's a light passion fruit sorbet with ground up beet cookie and raspberry jam. A mixture of delightful flavors and textures.
Honestly you can't go wrong with anything you get here.

Qi Austin,"I've been here twice in the past week for dinner, so I've tried lots of the entrees, rather than their dim sum dishes. I was really impressed by the food quality overall. Everything was cooked very well. However, the prices are on the high end for some of the entrees, and they also don't include rice with it so you have to order that separately. The entrees are pretty large though and good for family style sharing.

Favorite dishes: braised oxtail, shiitake and bok choy, and duck. The lobster and imperial tofu were just alright. Truffle egg fried rice was tasty, but the truffle flavor is very subtle and just tasted more like egg fried rice. Overall, I would probably come back here, since the food is good and ambiance is nice.","Food - Braised Oxtail (favorite), Shiitake and Bok Choy (favorite), Duck (favorite), Lobster (good but alright), Imperial Tofu (good but alright), Truffle Egg Fried Rice (tasty but underwhelming truffle flavor), Soup Dumplings (good), Salt & Pepper Lobster tail (good)||Price - high||Ambiance - Nice||Service - friendly and attentive "

Qi Austin,"I was losing hope about finding good dim sum in Austin, but I was blown away by this place! My group and I came here on a weekday night with a reservation in advance. The atmosphere is super intimate and relaxing.

We ordered a bunch of dim sum to share along with the house special fried rice and honey Akaushi beef. The dim sum were delicious, especially the soup dumplings. They were extremely flavorful and juicy. The beef was delicious, crispy on the outside but tender on the inside. The fried rice was delicious and flavorful too, though I wish the rice itself was a tad bit crispier.

The only thing lacking was the service. Our server was maybe an East Asian young man. It felt like our server was giving us attitude the entire night and didn't want to get us anything. My friend simply asked for some spoons for the sauces, but he assumed we were using them for the dim sum and explained to us how to eat the dim sum in an aggressive manner. He was super attentive in refilling our waters without us asking, but he poured the water so quickly that it splashed onto my plate of food and left a puddle of water. He didn't offer to change or clean the plate after acknowledging what happened. Maybe he had a bad day, but his aggressiveness left our table feeling super uncomfortable.

Other than that, the food is super delicious, although on the pricier side. If you decide to eat here, hopefully you'll get better service than we did.","Food - Dim Sum (Delicious, Extremely Flavorful), House Special Fried Rice (Delicious, Flavorful Broth), Honey Akaushi Beef (Delicious, Crispy)||Service - Lackluster, Attitude, No attention to detail||Price - High "

Then we ordered the truffle fried rice .. again.. nothing special but wasn't bad. And we ordered the pork belly and honey beef. They had rich flavors.
Lastly we ordered the green tea dessert. Now that was a 5/5!

Qi Austin,"Upon arriving, ambiance looked very nice and elegant place for a dim sum restaurant.
The wait was ""10 minutes"" but we waited for like 20 minutes.

When seated our server seemed nice, I forgot her name but she was this Asian waitress, looked Filipino.
We had horrible service, she didn't check on us often, she kept forgetting to get certain things we requested like our hot tea.
Every time we asked her for something it seemed like she was annoyed.
She even forgot to mark off items that we received and didn't really check up to see what we didn't.  At first everything came out pretty quick and the last 2 dishes took a VERY long time to come out and another waiter had to check for us.

Usually I enjoy regular soy and sate (chili oil), the sauce given was more sour tasting.  You have to request for regular soy for your dumplings.  The vinegar-y soy is meant for the soup dumplings.

Crab Meat Fish Maw Soup Dumpling (2/5) - I would pass on this, the soup dumping held together but it was very mushy and I didn't like the way it tasted.
Hakka Veggie Noodle (5/5) - I enjoyed this more than the zha jiang noodles.  Packed with veggies and flavor.
Scallop Caviar Sui Mai (5/5) - I was skeptical about ordering this but they ordered some and it was very good.  Small pieces of scallop, topped with crunchy caviar.
Lobster Dumpling (5/5) - Fresh, crunchy lobster meat, was really good.
SautÃ©ed Baby Bok Choy (4/5) - Needed a tad more seasoning but the bok Choy was cooked perfectly.  Still soft but crunchy.
Salt and Pepper Shrimp (3/5) - Had a lot of batter, I would pass.
Zha Jiang Noodle (3/5) - Almost like Dan Dan noodles, but I wanted more flavor.
Shrimp Har Kaw (5/5) - Shrimp tasted fresh, the dumpling itself wasn't falling apart like most har kaw.
Pork and Shrimp Sui Mai (5/5) - Not too porky like other sui mai. I liked the even amount of the shrimp and pork mixture.  Flavoring was great
Chicken Feet (4.5/5) - Soft enough fall off the bone and enjoy.  I liked the flavoring on this as well.
Sugarcane Shrimp (5/5) - Fried shrimp dumping on a sugarcane.  Savory shrimp with a slight sweetness from the sugarcane.  It was really good!
Curry Beef Puff (4/5) - Soft but flakey, beef was kind of chewy.  Wasn't the greatest puff I've had but wasn't too bad.","Food - Crab Meat Fish Maw Soup Dumpling (mushy), Hakka Veggie Noodle (enjoyed), Scallop Caviar Sui Mai (very good), Lobster Dumpling (fresh, crunchy), Sautéed Baby Bok Choy (needed more seasoning), Salt and Pepper Shrimp (lot of batter), Zha Jiang Noodle (lacked flavor), Shrimp Har Kaw (fresh shrimp), Pork and Shrimp Sui Mai (great flavoring), Chicken Feet (soft, enjoy), Sugarcane Shrimp (good), Curry Beef Puff (soft, chewy beef)||Service - Horrible, slow, unfriendly "

Qi Austin,"Fantastic experience. Loved the ambiance and atmosphere, excellent service. Waiters were super friendly.

Here's the breakdown:

1) crab meat fish maw soup dumpling: skin was good, very thin but didn't break. could've had more soup inside but filling was good. liked it better than the shanghai XLB. 4/5

2) shanghai XLB: skin was nice and thin, didn't break. good amount of soup to filling ratio. filling was not as tasty - it lacked a lil smth 4/5

3) snow crab ball: hard pass on this one. couldn't taste the crab - just tasted like fried batter. think corn dog 2.5/5

Qi Austin,"I can't believe I didn't take any photos of the dim sum... but when you lose track of time like that, that's how you know you had a good time.

Chose the patio to catch up with some girlfriends and overall, we had a great time. We opted for family style, and chose a few dim sum plates, a soup, a couple of entrees and a dessert.
Liked everything we had except the bao, but My friend did. I prefer the steam versions with bbq pork vs a meatball inside.

Also, I grew up eating $3 dim sum, so just know it's not like the old school dim sum places with a cart. To me, the price is high for dim sum, but the price is about average compared to other trendy ATX restaurants. We dined on the patio and it was covered and nice. We ubered, so didn't get to see what Parking was like.

Bathroom tip: There are only 2 bathrooms in the back, and on a Friday night it was busy with a line. I'd definitely just use the one in the lobby. The restaurant is connected to some sort of main lobby for maybe a hotel or shops. The bathroom there was clean and no line.

All in all, good experience. I would return.","Food - Bao (not good), Dim Sum (good), Soup (good), Entrees (good), Dessert (good)||Location - Connected to main lobby||Parking - Not easy||Price - High "

Qi Austin,"I was visiting Austin for work and initially, I was disappointed we weren't going to bbq. The place is outstanding. We were a larger group and reserved the private room upstairs. The room is beautifully decorated with an opulent chandelier as long as the table. This is not your typical dim sum, this is more upscale and no carts.

They have an impressive wine list. We were with people who go there often so we told them to order for the table. We had the soup dumplings. Wow, they were some of the best I've ever had. We followed that with the peking duck. This is a must. Perfectly cooked with a crispy skins. I was a little full after the 1st round of food, but I also tried the spicy chicken with pine nuts and sesame chicken.

Qi Austin,"Lin Asian is one of our favorites and Qi is just as good.  All the dishes from soup dumplings to honey beef, pot stickers had flare and flavor.

Qi has inventive twists on traditional Chinese fare and I can't wait to go back.   Fried chicken is a must!

Qi Austin,"I'm in between a 4 to 5 for this restaurant. First off, the impression was ruined because they did not very specifically state that dim sum brunch was only weekends (Friday not included), and even their resy states dim sum brunch, but it's not the full dim sum menu. However, they redeemed themselves with a very well made beef bao found on their very small dim sum selection for lunch. The bao was crispy on the outside (pan fried), and fluffy and soft on the inside with a very savory and umami beef stuffing. Could arguably be one of the best beef baos I have had in a long time. The soup dumpling is decently well done, lots of soup in there but the meat filling tasted like it had a little too much corn flour in the marinade. We also ordered the truffle egg fried rice, which was fluffy and well seasoned but I'm not sure I like the truffle flavor in there; and the pecan shrimp, which tasted just like a very well made honey walnut shrimp. In short, the dim sum here seems pretty good but the lunch menu seems like a slightly elevated version of what you would get t a Chinese restaurant but not something that would blow your minds off, which was the expectations I had for Qi, especially given the price point. Would recommend trying once for those who've never been either of the sister restaurants.","Food - Beef Bao (crispy on the outside, fluffy and soft on the inside, very savory and umami beef stuffing), Soup Dumpling (decently well done, lots of soup in there but the meat filling tasted like it had a little too much corn flour in the marinade), Truffle Egg Fried Rice (fluffy and well-seasoned, not a fan of the truffle flavor), Pecan Shrimp (very well made)||Location - Midtown||Price - high "
Qi Austin,"San Diegan who came here with my husband. We were still kind of stuffed from our bbq lunch but I thought it was great. Got the fried rice that was loaded with meats. It's expensive but good quality, yummy and we made it out entree. Also got the classic soup dumplings and beef potstickers which were great. My man thought the soup dumplings were lacking but I very much enjoyed. Plus they give you a cute little dumpling bowl (that I almost poured my sake into!)","Food - fried rice (good quality, yummy), soup dumplings (lacking), beef potstickers(great)||Ambiance - Cozy and inviting||Service - Friendly and attentive "
Qi Austin,"We picked this place because brother wanted Dim Sum, but it was a pleasant surprise. Upscale Chinese dishes are served in this farm to table family restaurant. The patio was lovely and we needed the torch heater our server turned on for us! Brrr.

So, the dim sum is not trolleyed around in little carts you say yes or no to, but rather is listed on the menu. Most dishes are three to five pieces so perfect for sharing in our party of five.

We ordered two of the 3-piece pan fried akaushi beef bao, the lobster dumplings, crab and fish maw soup dumplings, and akaushi beef potstickers which come stuck to a beautiful lacy crispy wonton fan. Every single dumpling we tried was a flavor burst in our mouths. So delicious.

I had General Tso chicken with a side of this, gelatinous hot sour soup. The hot was there, but the soup was not sour at all and could benefit from some Chinese dark vinegar. My entree was good, but very bland and the chicken was a little dry. All their batters are cornstarch, so very light. Just not successful with this dish. My daughter had the peppered shrimp and shared; it was sooo good, *that's the dish I recommend!

Overall delicious food and impeccable service!","Food - General Tso Chicken (good but bland), Peppered Shrimp (recommended)||Ambiance - Lovely Patio||Service - Impeccable "

Qi Austin,"I had high expectations with Qi after seeing all the good reviews.  Maybe we went during the lunch hour, the food were just not matching with the prices.  We got the 3 items that were recommended by our server.  Sui Mai was pretty good, but not good enough to pay more than $5 for each.  The Shanghai soup dumplings were terrible, it tasted like raw pork and the skin breaks when you pick them up, so no juice left. ( most likely just undercooked)  We were so looking forward to the $40 half duck, it wasn't terrible just fairly standard with 3 Bao to go with it.  Duck Skin wasn't crispy and the meat wasn't flavorful.  The Bao was nothing special, maybe I am just used to the traditional duck serve with thin pancakes instead of Bao.   Our server was very nice, I may give them another try during dinner time, hopefully they will have better food.","Food - Sui Mai (pretty good), Shanghai Soup Dumplings (terrible, undercooked), Half Duck (not good, not flavorful, crispy skin)||Service - Nice "
Qi Austin,"This place isn't ""terrible"" but the price point is outrageous for what is probably the 3rd worst dim sum I've ever had (2nd if we dismiss vegan dim sum.)

As a life long east coast cantonese person with grandparents and an auntie in New York City, the only time my parents ate out was to have dim sum with extended family. Even before middle school I've developed my fasting strategy to pack as much dim sum into my little body as possible because it's thattttt special to me.

The menu items are easily 2 if not 3x the amount of a normal dim sum joint and it's not a true dim sum parlor with carts. The menu was a mixture of both classic and new school dim sum choices you order off a piece of paper not unlike a sushi joint.

My least favorite was the pan fried beef buns. They were dry, not juicy and they definitely needed a little more time pan frying since the junction between The fried bottom and steamed top was gummy. And the lack of moisture on the inside and relatively dry marble of meat was the antithesis of what makes this dish great because it's /supposed to/ be a little umami explosion like a streamed bun and xiu long bao hybrid. I ended up just eating the meat inside and leaving most of the bun on the plate because I paid for it and wasn't going to let even mediocre meat go to waste (dem Asian genes.)

This is followed by the har gow (shrimp dumplings). They had a generous portion of shrimp but once again it was bizarrely on the dry side and the dumpling wrapper was not chewy and delicate but rather thick and a bit gummy. This is my favorite dish to get at dim sum and most places don't do a great job so I could have let it slide if it wasn't over 2x the price.

The crispy sea cucumber har gao was the only fusion dim sum i tried and it was okay I guess. It came with a creamy gray sauce which I suppose has cuddlefish ink and probably kewpie. I wish it was mentioned in the description on the menu but oh well. What I didn't like about this dish is that the sea cucumber itself is inpercieveable and I'd you didn't tell me they were in there, I wouldn't know. (Sea cucumber is very mild in flavor but had a characteristic, gelatinous, almost ""crispy"" bite which is why I was surprised that this ""har gao"" was fried because I thought it meant that the crispness came from the sea cucumber.)

The best thing I had here was the siu mai. This actually was good, substantial in size, not dry (I wouldn't say juicy though ... I think there was probably (too much?) cornstarch as a binder because nothing here was ""juicy"" which is one of the nicer qualities of excellent dim sum.)

All the cooks making the dim sum that day were all mandarin speakers or Latinos - not that they're incapable of making excellent food but to me it suggests how many degrees removed it is from authentic Cantonese dim sum. Y'all know what I mean when you eat Mexican food without a Mexican in the kitchen, it doesn't hit right because they didn't grow up eating or making this like we did.

Service left a lot to be desired as well - i sat in a corner as a solo diner which I didn't mind but the pacing was weird where I got my first course immediately but waited about 20 minutes after I finished my 3rd dumps tray before the remainder of my order arrived. After taking my order and dropping off my drink, he didn't touch my table at all until it was time to drop off the bill. The bussers were good though and made a point of hitting every table when clearing dishes.

Long story short the aesthetics were nice but don't bring actual cantonese people here. This is the sriracha Mayo and eel sauce deep fried ""deluxe roll"" equivalent of dim sum.","Food - Har Gow (dry), Pan Fried Beef Bun (dry, gummy buns), Crispy Sea Cucumber Har Gao (okay), Siu Mai (good, substantial, not dry), Pan Sear Basil Chicken Dumpling (tough skin), Steam BBQ Pork & Shrimp Bun (soggy)||Service - Weird pacing, distant||Ambiance - Nice "

Qi Austin,"I really don't get what the hype is.  The ambiance is nice.  But other than that, there's nothing good to say.  If you are going for upscale feel, then make sure your bowls and plates are not chipped or wore.  The water ""cup"" is so cheap and was it aluminum?  We ordered the jasmine tea and that is the cheapest jasmine tea I've ever tasted. It's bitter and just not good.
Sugar shrimp - shrimp way too salty.  No sweet sauce to go with it whatsoever.  
Shao-Ling-Bao - the filling is juicy which is nice.  But the meat itself is not the best quality.
Chicken feet - it's ok!
Chives shrimp dumpling - the best dish we have here.  But the presentation is super sloppy.

The food was great but just know pricing is expensive if you are coming with hungry bellies. I would come back here as a date night, not as a family night outing. Portions are definitely for 2.

Food was mouth watering but not anything that I could have probably have enjoyed for less in price. Pork belly was Juicy, tender and perfectly cooked. Pecan shrimp was the winner for my children. They wanted more of it. We also ordered drinks from the bar, you won't be disappointed. We ordered fried rice, that was basic like any fried rice.

Qi Austin,"After reading reviews online, I was very excited to try Qi. Upon arrival (we did not make reservations) we were told it would be an hour wait for indoor dining, or could eat instantly on the patio, which is what we preferred.

The ambiance of the patio/general reatraunt was modern, trendy, and very clean - a welcoming environment.

I ordered the coconut margarita, which I found refreshing and delicious - a great option for a warm TX day.
The worst part if the experience was the service, as our waiter seemed annoyed he was working, and seemed like he wanted to rush us into ordering.

For appetizers we had several dim sum (chicken basil dumplings, soup dumplings, and the beef pot sticker) and they were all good, but none were a ""must order.""

For entrees, my 3 guests and I all ordered individually, and were a bit annoyed that all our entrees came out at seperate times, with the time between the first and last person getting their entree between 15-20 minutes. We wanted to enjoy our dinners at the same time, and when we asked the waiter why they came out seperately, he simply said that some dishes take longer.

The entree I had was a spicy pine nut chicken dish which, while good, did not blow me away at all - and for a dish advertised as spicy, there was a lack of heat.

Ultimately, a good experience that could have been great, as it was let down by the service - I likely will not be back soon","Food - Coconut Margarita (refreshing), Dim Sum (good but not a must order), Beef Pot Sticker (good), Soup Dumplings (good), Spicy Pine Nut Chicken Dish (good but lacked heat)||Ambiance - Modern, trendy, clean||Service - Annoyed waiter, slow||Menu - Separate entrees||Drinks - Coconut Margarita (refreshing)||Food - Dim Sum (good but not a must order), Beef Pot Sticker (good), Soup Dumplings (good)||Location - Modern, trendy, clean "

Qi Austin,"This is one of my new favorite Asian restaurants. The atmosphere and decor is absolutely stunning. I enjoyed admiring all of the unique traditional decorations.

To start off, I ordered the chicken basil dumplings, which were cooked to perfection and very savory.

As an entree, I ordered the seafood curry. I'm not lying when I tell you that this is the best curry I have ever tasted. Who would've thought that seafood in curry would be such a wonderful experience for your taste buds? You can tell that the seafood they used in the curry was great quality.

Qi Austin,"Qi is a restaurant I really want to like because the food is really tasty, but I have had multiple frustrating visits and would be hesitant to go back until the restaurant is managed better.

We like to eat later in the evening and as a general rule assume if a restaurant is taking reservations for a certain time, that they will be able to accommodate guests that book at this time.  This is definitely not the case at Qi.  We had booked a later reservation and almost immediately were told the kitchen was closing and we had to get our order in.  Once we placed our order everything came out immediately (which meant most of our food got cold) and we felt unwelcome and left without finishing.

We chalked our bad experience to bad luck an decided to give it a second shot, this time booking a slightly earlier reservation.  Unfortunately, the experience wasn't much better.  We were rushed to order entrees which due to a miscommunication came out before the appetizers (the server interpreted ""give us five minutes on the entrees"" to mean we didn't actually want any of the appetizers we ordered).  We asked if it was possible to keep the entrees warm in the kitchen while we ate our appetizers and were told 'no'.  Sensing our frustration, the server got her manager who essentially told us the restaurant closes at 10 and that despite the Resy app suggesting in multiple places ""bookings are for two hours"" we should not have anticipated if we booked for nine to be able to eat at a leisurely pace.  This is fine, but pretty atypical (and as a general rule, I don't check the closing time of a restaurant).

The food though is really good, the cocktail list is thoughtful (combining some traditional cocktails with their own originals), and the drinks are well-constructed.  I certainly can imagine myself and others having a good experience at Qi.  That said, I think they need to decide what they want to be as a restaurant.  They have a fantastic location (which can't be cheap) and a fancy ambiance, but they don't back it up with staff who know how to run a restaurant.",Food - Fantastic||Location - Fancy||Ambiance - Nice||Service - Lackluster

Qi Austin,"What can I say?  I'm super excited to have found Qi and the food definitely didn't disappointed. While this is considered a fusion place, it is still delicious and worth the visit. Anyway, I was in town for a conference and decided to try Qi after doing some research on recent restaurant openings. I came here with two dear friends (one is from the UK) after the conference. I will say that if you've never been before, you may need some help to find the place - it is inside an office building on the ground floor. You will need to park on the 4th floor and take the elevator down to 1st floor, then go past the main desk and there will be a door to the restaurant. When you go back to the car, you will need to use the last 2 elevators (the 2 furthest away from the information desk). The others will require a card entry since they only go to the offices. Back to Qi:  since we were coming from a reception where we had slight appetizers, we decided to order some Dim Sum items. The dim sum items definitely did not disappoint!  The Har Kaw skin was just the perfect texture with a slight chew and the shrimp inside was flavorful. The Xiaolong Bao was just okay - I've had better. However, it didn't detract from the overall experience. The lobster dumplings were savory and it tasted buttery - not sure if that's just from the natural sweetness of the lobster or if the lobster was poached in butter before being put in the dumpling. The scallop caviar sui mai was tasty, though I do prefer the normal sui mai. The pan seared basil chicken dumplings are absolutely heavenly and perhaps my favorite. The filling was flavorful and the outside was crispy and perfectly pan fried. The star of the night, however, was the seafood delight with curry sauce. All the seafood in the dish was cooked perfectly, and the delicious curry sauce wasn't overpowering but did provide the perfect foil to the seafood. Sooo yummy!  I will definitely be returning to try their other dishes.","Food - Har Kaw (perfect texture), Xiaolong Bao (not good), Lobster Dumplings (savory, buttery), Scallop Caviar Sui Mai (tasty), Pan Seared Basil Chicken Dumplings (heavenly), Seafood Delight with Curry Sauce (cooked perfectly, delicious curry sauce wasn't overpowering)||Location - Inside an office building||Parking - Parking garage available||Service - Help finding the location||Elevators - Working||Menu - Huge "

Qi Austin,"My boyfriend and I had a reservation for two on valentines day (today) since January 20th. We received an email saying our reservation was canceled yesterday and we have been trying to call the restaurant since to see what happened bc this was really uncalled for and we were wondering if it was a mistake. After multiple attempts of calling the restaurant only to have someone pick up and then hangup, we finally got someone on the phone. When I told him what happened and asked if he could just check on it for me, he proceeds to tell me ""if you call us back at 2pm we can help you but we are busy right now"" and then hangs up.

I have been looking forward to dining at Qi for a while now and we had made our reservation weeks in advance only to have it abruptly canceled the day of and to rudely be told to call back when they're not busy. I honestly don't even want to eat here anymore because the service is obviously not worth the money and this inconvenience is a big turn off for me.

Maybe one day I'll be inclined to try again but seeing how they handle mistakes that they made for our reservation, it makes me doubt that they'll honor any future reservation we make.","Food - General Tso's Chicken (nice fry), Sesame Chicken (nice fry), Akaushi Beef with Green Pepper (great flavor), Honey Akaushi Beef with SautÃƒÂ©ed Pepper (great flavor)||Service - Rude, unprofessional, disorganized||Location - 7618 Beverly Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90036||Phone - (323) 6555-8881||Website - qirestaurant.com "

Qi Austin,"Qi Austin was awesome! From the food, to the ambiance, to the bathrooms, I definitely plan on returning!

From the moment we walked in it was good. The restaurant is elegantly designed, with large, fancy wooden doors. When you enter, an elegant long table is to the left of you and the rest of the place is beautifully designed in traditional Chinese fashion. A large attractive painting overlooks the bar.

The staff seemed busy and a bit stressed but, were kind and sat us promptly since I had a reservation. We did have to wait a bit for service, but I just assume that they're understaffed like everyone else right now. The waiter did a great job once he greeted us and did apologize for the wait. He also explained to us how to eat everything appropriately since it was our first time having Dim Sum there.

The food was awesome. I think the sesame balls were the best I've ever had. They were enormous and had the perfect red bean taste and consistency that lingered in your mouth for awhile.

The BBQ pork buns were probably a second favorite, along with the crab soup dumplings. The crab soup dumplings had a lot of flavor and didn't even really need the side sauces they gave us.

The lobster dumplings were delicious but hot in temperature! Be careful when eating them.

The steam egg cream bun was amazing for desert.

We walked out stuffed but 10/10 would return.

Also, the bathrooms are crazy cool! I walked in and the toilet just opened automatically and had a heated seat and everything. They definitely spent a lot on the bathroom design.","Food - Sesame balls (best ever), BBQ pork buns (favorite), Crab soup dumplings (flavorful), Lobster dumplings (delicious but hot), Steam egg cream bun (amazing)||Ambiance - Elegant design, Large fancy wooden doors, Attractive painting overlooking the bar||Service - Kind, Busy, Stressed||Bathrooms - Cool design, Automatic closing and heated seats||Menu - Dim Sum||Location - Elegantly designed||Price - Awesome "
Qi Austin,"The dumplings are the star of this place and they are simply divine. Great variety of flavors and ingredients and the execution on the dishes is simply top notch.

Loved the Shanghai pork dumplings and Caviar Scallop dumplings the best.

The pan fried Akaushi bao buns were also excellent. This is as good as any of the best dumpling places in Shanghai.

5 stars are well deserved.

Service was prompt and friendly.","Food - Shanghai Pork Dumplings (divine), Caviar Scallop Dumplings (divine), Pan Fried Akaushi Bao Buns (excellent)||Service - Prompt and friendly "
Qi Austin,"Myself and 4 other friends came on a Friday night to Qi. First impression was not the best, we had an 8:30 reservation and we're not seated until almost 9pm. However, the reason why I gave Qi a five star review is because our server and food made for the poor first impression. We started off with drinks. I had the Cosmopolitan; very good, stiff pour but tasty. For appetizers with got soup dumplings and pot stickers. The Shanghai soup dumplings are the best I've ever had. The melt in your mouth. The broth is so flavorful and warm. Ugh, I dream about these dumplings. Other members in my party raved over the pot stickers. For entrees, we did family style and got the sesame chicken, house fried rice combo, spicy chicken, and sticky rice. The sesame chicken was by far the best entree. At the end of the meal, our server took off the orders of soup dumplings off our check to apologize for the wait for our table. We didn't ask for this, so it was extremely nice of them to do that and is the reason by review went from a 4 star to a 5 star. Will I be back soon....absolutely!

Qi Austin,"Great ambiance, not bad food. We went to celebrate something, sat at the bar. The bar tender was able to make decent non-alcoholic mock tails for us. For starters we had soup dumplings and beef bao. Both were extremely average. Definitely had much better elsewhere. But the ambiance makes up for it. For mains we took Honey Sizzling beef and the salt and pepper lobster! Beef was ok, lobster was amazing! Would I go again - sure! Loved our time there. But again, not the best food.","Food - Soup Dumplings (average), Beef Bao (average), Honey Sizzling Beef (ok), Salt and Pepper Lobster (amazing)||Ambiance - Great||Service - Decent||Drinks - Non-alcoholic mocktails||Menu - Extremely average "
Qi Austin,"My friend and I went here on a Friday night. We didn't have a reservation but luckily they had some seats open. They were very busy though, so my recommendation is that you make a reservation before you go.
To start, we got the Shanghai soup dumplings. They came out piping hot and fresh and were delicious!  For entrees we ordered the Crispy alligator and Peking duck. The alligator left much to be desired. It was certainly crispy and a little spicy, but I felt like I was eating more breading than actual alligator meat. The Peking duck on the other hand was very good. The duck was well cooked and the skin was perfectly crispy. The portion size was also enough for two people and came with bao buns. I would highly recommend getting it if you like duck.
Overall, I would visit here again!","Food - Shanghai soup dumplings (delicious), Crispy alligator (certainly crispy but lacked flavor), Peking duck (very good, well-cooked duck, perfect portion size)||Ambiance - Busy, inviting||Service - Friendly, attentive "
Qi Austin,"If anyone was curious if Qi was really worth it, I would say that if you are going to spend that dough, go all out for the dinner menu as opposed to lunch/brunch. It wasn't bad at all. It was actually excellent but their sister restaurant Lin offers the same. The dinner here is where you'll get the innovative stuff like - Szechuan Peppercorn alligator. Meanwhile I go and take my own advice, here are photos of the dimsum brunch which are, again, just the classic dimsum.

What makes them great though is they intentionally play with the dimensions of the food. For example, their shrimp sugarcane, har cow and shrimp dumplings are all minced shrimp but they have different levels of fat and density, chunky or smooth paste. I think this is the distinction from a standard dimsum place. Unlike other fancy western restaurants, they do not stand you up on the portions. Both size and quantity are wealthy and the price justify both the portion and quantity. There aren't any ""filler"" ingredients either like too much woodear mushrooms or waterchestnuts. Succulent, juicy and without artificial enhancers like MSG or like flavoring.

Out of what I ate, this is what for sure encourage you to try for yourself

Soup Dumplings ($11) because they are the best in Austin disconsidering price and has the most clean broth

Shrimp Harcow ($11) because the shrimp stuffing chunky and juicy with a cute rabbit wrapping

Pork Shrimp Sui Mai ($11) because you'll see chunks of meat

We ordered...
Zha Jiang noodles: fresh noodles. Good, but I wasn't too fond of it.
Peking duck: duck to bun ratio is a little off. Not the best one I've had, but it's still pretty good.
Salt and pepper tofu: I strongly recommend getting this! The batter is light, seasoned and crispy, and the tofu is silky soft.
Shanghai soup dumplings: delicious. Be careful about biting into it- I had one or two explode on me. Absolutely worth it though.
Cocktails: gold digger, Qi lychee tini // both were tasty, though the lychee tini wasn't as sweet as I thought it was be- it's quite floral. Gold digger was an absolute delight to look at.
Dessert: green tea cremoso, mango bomb // I hope you have a dessert stomach because these were amazing. I also strongly recommend that y'all order these.
Rice was overcooked

Service: 5 stars
Staff wears PPE, and there's hand sanitizer provided at the table. When things get busy, it's hard to get your server's attention, but that's kind of expected. We had a small issue and the manager addressed it promptly, which was very much so appreciated.

Venue: 5 stars
Well decorated and such a cool vibe. Indoor and outdoor seating are available, and if you plan on coming in at 7 on a weekend, I really hope you made reservations. There's a window where you can see the kitchen staff work on your food, and a bar decorated with a beautiful glass leaves sculpture. If driving in downtown Austin stresses you out too, there's free parking behind Qi so you don't have to worry about street parking. Qi is located at the corner of the building, and parking is just behind that.

Qi Austin,"First time coming here and first dim sum brunch, and everything was phenomenal! The ambiance of the restaurant, the freshness of the food, the quality and flavor of everything on the menu. It was a great experience - and you almost forget that you're in downtown Austin, as the beauty and upscale of the indoor seating really transports you.

I didn't take pictures of everything, but my favorites were the zha jiang noodles (so good), the soup dumplings (some of the best I've ever had), and the shrimp har gow. You honestly can't do wrong with anything, though! And the cocktails were strong, unique, and delightful.

Overall, the experience was a 5/5, the food was a 5/5, and the service was a 5/5! I would go back again and highly recommend.

Qi Austin,"Qi is a modern Asian Kitchen located in downtown Austin. We went there for lunch and I'm super glad that we were able to try this place out. The dim sum here is of great quality. The decor is very modern and gives you that classy vibe. We ordered a good variety of items and were impressed with them, especially the soup dumplings. These soup dumplings had great texture and also the soup had wonderful flavors to it. The Salt and pepper shrimp had a nice flavor of the wok, which is very rare but makes such a huge difference to elevate the taste of the dish. I don't think there's anything I wouldn't want to try here.","Food - Dim Sum (great quality), Modern Decor||Service - Classy||Location - Downtown "
Qi Austin,Make sure you make reservations prior arriving as it will be packed.  The host was kind enough to seat us early.  The staffs were very nice and helpful.  The crab soup dumplings were very good and tasty.  Make sure you put the dumplings in the small bowl provided then drip a few drops of the vinegar on top to let the flavors mixed in.  Be sure to open up the dumplings with the spoon then eat.  Do not put the whole thing into your mouth as it will be very hot.  I will definitely come back here again.,"Food - Crab Soup Dumplings (very good, recommended)||Service - Nice and Helpful||Ambiance - Nice||Host - Kind "
Qi Austin,"Qi Austin was a wonderful experience! I came here with a couple of friends that knew their way around the menu. They essentially took over and practically ordered the entire menu. My personal favorites during this outing were the pork SLB, lobster dumpling, and the peking duck. The service was wonderful. Our server Danny was thoughtful enough to space out the orders so our table wasn't overloaded because we definitely ordered enough to have plenty of leftovers.

I'd definitely come here again when I'm in a treat myself mood.","Food - Pork soup dumplings (nice broth, soft dumplings), Lobster dumpling (delicious), Peking duck (excellent)||Service - Wonderful||Ambiance - Great "
Qi Austin,"We went here on a Sunday for brunch and it was fairly busy so I would recommend setting up a reservation like we had done through open table.

FOOD: The food was a little lackluster - their pork buns were decent tasting but small and the soup dumplings were good, but nothing special that wow'ed me and even smaller than the buns. The bok choy had zero flavor other than the garlicky bits - it was as if they had been boiled and that's it. Overall, the fact that the sangria was the highlight of the meal suggests a disappointing dim sum. Plus, the whole meal was $25 even after splitting and sangria is $9 which means that, for an order of bok choy, pork buns, and soup dumplings, the total was around $32! Not worth the price.

SERVICE: I called ahead of time because I was running late for my 11am reservation and the person who picked up 1) interrupted me while I was talking and 2) told me that it was ok since the next reservation wasn't until 1pm. My friend who got there before me also said that the person they talked to was a little rude and told her that we needed to be out by 12:30pm. We felt so rushed and even after all that, we were there past 12:30...The servers were generally good about refilling and checking in, but we were very put off by the experience with the reservation. The place was busy but not packed enough to warrant such impatience.

LOCATION: The restaurant itself is very pretty with a beautiful bar area and cool umbrella decor hanging from the ceiling. You have to walk up some stairs in order to access the restaurant and it wasn't clear to me whether I had to go through the huge metal black doors which you have to cross their outdoor patio dining area to get to or to go through the glass doors that connect to an even larger building that aren't part of the restaurant. The table for 2 that we were sitting at was a little smaller than I'd like, especially since dim sum is meant to fill up a table. Random highlight: their bathrooms have fancy toilets which open the toilet cover and flush automatically.","Food - Pork buns (lackluster), Soup dumplings (good but small), Bok Choy (boiled and bland), Ambiance - Pretty with cool umbrella decor||Service - Impatient and rude||Price - high "
Qi Austin,"This place is nice quaint place with excellent food, service & staff. They sat us at a big table because we had a group of ten. We waited only a little bit for the table and they made sure everything was clean and sanitized for us.

we ordered drinks like the Watermelon cooler cocktail and appetizers like egg rolls and pot stickers. The food can be made to share because you can order some fried rice and then a chicken plate and share it so you can get a taste of more than one thing.

I like the decor of the place along with the ambiance. The staff is very attentive and friendly. The bathrooms are very nice and clean with powered toilets. You have to enter through the door in front of the patio seating.

For the entree, I order the truffle egg fried rice which is done with Jasmine rice and it was delicious along with the egg rolls. Hubby ordered the crispy alligator and enjoyed it. He'll probably order it again after he has tried everything else.  It just has to be your thing. Everything was presented beautifully and it tasted just as good along with the yummy cocktails they have there as well.

There is parking areas all around so you shouldn't have much of a problem with that. I would definitely recommend this place and know that this place is higher end so you will leave with a hefty bill but everything is great and time there was a joy as well. I will be returning.","Food - Truffle egg fried rice (delicious), Egg rolls (good), Crispy alligator (enjoyed, would order again), Watermelon cooler cocktail (refreshing), Pot stickers (good)||Ambiance - Nice decor||Service - Attentive, friendly||Parking - Available||Price - high "

Qi Austin,"Very nice neo-Chinese cuisine with East meats west concept. From the naming (Qi instead of the antiquated spelling of ""Chi""), decor, music choice, menu, tableware, to plating, it gives Austin an opportunity to experience current trends in authentic Chinese dining.

The dim sum itself was pretty decent, with a better than average portion. Truffle fried rice was very delicious! The mustard green stir fry isn't a real dish in Chinese cuisine. It would be better if they offer other Cantonese leafy green stir fries such as baby bak choy, Yau choy, morning glory etc to complement the dim sum which is a Cantonese cuisine. Would be great to offer tea option to go with, or even boba or spiked boba drinks which would suit the modern dining theme as well.","Food - Dim Sum (decent portion), Truffle Fried Rice (very delicious), Mustard Green Stir Fry (not a real dish)||Ambiance - Modern with Chinese decor||Music - Chinese music "
Qi Austin,"I've heard wonderful things about Qi and I'm so glad I finally had the chance to visit! It's definitely become one of my favorite restaurants in Austin. I came here with a group of 5 and was able to get a great taste of their menu. We ordered the crab meat soup dumplings, Shanghai soup dumplings, shu mai, bird's nest, truffle fried rice, and Peking duck! The soup dumplings were so tender and juicy, and I especially loved the crab meat one. The shu mai was also incredible, and the fish eggs on top were the perfect touch. The bird's nest was such a creative dish with an assortment of colorful vegetables in a wonton shell. The truffle fried rice was super fluffy and you could taste the amazing truffle flavor. The Peking duck was also well-cooked and came with Baos and green onion/sauces.

Overall, I had a great first impression walking into the beautiful place, decorated with stunning umbrellas and golden leaf decor hanging from the ceiling, cultural wall art, and cushion seating that resembled Chinese red envelopes. The ambience of the place combined with the fantastic service and delicious food made for an unforgettable dim sum experience!","Food - Crab Meat Soup Dumplings (tender and juicy), Shanghai Soup Dumplings (tender and juicy), Shu Mai (incredible), Bird's Nest (creative, colorful vegetables), Truffle Fried Rice (fluffy, amazing truffle flavor), Peking Duck (well-cooked)||Ambiance - Beautiful, decorated with stunning umbrellas, cultural wall art, cushion seating||Service - Fantastic||Menu - Dim Sum||Location -  "
Qi Austin,"My boyfriend and I went to Qi for our anniversary and it was a wonderful time! From the service to all the details in coursing out the meal I was pleasantly surprised.

For all who know this is a sister restaurant to Lin's with a little bit more experimentation in the food. Lins is very traditional whereas Qi has a couple different elements thrown in...one dish that came to mind is the truffle fried rice we had.

The meal started off with a couple different appetizers, my boyfriend and I aren't super ""big"" eaters so we ordered the bao buns as well as the traditional soup dumplings. Soup dumplings never get old for me, they are probably one of my favorite things to eat since I discovered them about 2-3 years ago.

Our entree consisted of the half Peking duck and truffle fried rice. Not really much to elaborate on for these two dishes minus that the Peking duck comes with only 3 buns, so if you want more you have to order more to accompany your meal. The truffle fried rice had good truffle flavor and was a simple egg fried rice with truffle oil and a tad bit of truffle.

My only gripe about Qi was that the owner or manager kept sitting in the space next to me because I'm assuming he was friends with someone at the table next to us. The atmosphere and food make us want to come back for some dim sum and drinks with a small group of friends next time.","Food - Bao buns (good), Soup dumplings (great), Truffle fried rice (good truffle flavor, simple egg fried rice with truffle oil and a bit of truffle), Peking duck (good), Truffle fried rice (good truffle flavor, simple egg fried rice with truffle oil and a bit of truffle)||Service - Good||Ambiance - Good||Menu - Huge "
Qi Austin,"A well-deserved 5-star rating for this place!  Everything from the service, the food, and the atmosphere was a huge hit!  Came here with a party of 6 on a Saturday afternoon.  We were able to make a reservation that morning.  Arrived shortly before our reservation time and our table was ready and we were immediately seated.  Our server (Sophia, originally from Vietnam) was phenomenal.  Super sweet personality and incredibly helpful on some of the menu items especially for a few in our party who were vegans.

The dim sum lunch menu had plenty of great options.  I tried the chicken dumpling along with the veggie noodle dish.  Both dishes were perfectly cooked and tasted really great!

One of our guests was celebrating a birthday and the staff brought out this chocolate dessert that was incredible!  Everything on the plate was edible and made of some sort of dark chocolate.  The presentation was so beautiful that it was really hard to take pieces of it as it felt as though we were destroying an art piece.  Indeed it was an art piece.  I sure hope the pics do it justice.

Although I'm not local to the Austin area, I do frequent here about once a year or so.  I would most certainly come back here for dinner, which has even more of a menu offering.","Food - Dim Sum (perfectly cooked chicken dumplings, veggie noodle dish), Dessert (beautifully decorated, incredible)||Service - Phenomenal, Helpful||Ambiance - Great||Location - Convenient "
Qi Austin,"Came on a Wednesday night to celebrate my Bfs 31st! Unfortunately, we didn't make a reservation and the place was packed! We ended up ditto on on the patio, which was raised above the street. Despite, the windy weather outside, service was still fantastic. They also have Japanese toilets inside!

We ordered the Soup dumplings, Peking Duck, Seafood Flat Noodle, and Pecan Shrimp. Soup dumplings were pretty good in my opinion. A thicker dumpling wrapper than I'm used too, but the broth was still delicious. Peking duck was my favorite dish! Interesting in came with 3 baos, it definitely needed more! If you get the seafood flat noodle, get ready for a full bowl of veggies and seafood. I wasn't a fan of the flavor, but loved the portion size.

Overall, solid Asian fusion restaurant. It was a little pricy for my liking, but will go back for the Peking duck!","Food - Soup Dumplings (pretty good, Thicker dumpling wrapper), Peking Duck (Favorite, Needed more Bao), Seafood Flat Noodle (Not good, Full bowl of veggies and seafood), Pecan Shrimp(Solid)||Service - Fantastic||Ambiance - Raised patio, Japanese toilets "
Qi Austin,"Dear manager,

I'm the customer. As promised, one star for your attitude and your restaurant.

Your host has prepared us a table by the entrance and you can't just walk in later and say ""No, you can't sit there. That table is for a bigger party."" And when we questioned you, you said ""I'm the manager here."" I just don't think that's the right way to treat your customer and that's not how you do business.

Qi Austin,"Great service and platform.  The food I thought was nothing special.  Seemed to be sweeter than Im used to for non sweet dishes.  The hot and sour soup was more like sweet and sour.  Although I put the spiciest option down, it was not hot at all in my opinion.  We had three entrees  and the  beef one was nice and tender, just that everything just kind of tasted the same to me. I was a bit disappointed given all the reviews.","Food - Hot and Sour Soup (more like Sweet and Sour), Beef (nice and tender), Chicken (not so great)||Service - Great||Ambiance - Nice "
Qi Austin,"This dim sum restaurant has been my favorite restaurant in our whole trip to Austin so far! The interior of the restaurant is very well decorated, and we were able to make a reservation at the dim sum bar. We got to sit right in front of the ladies that were making the dim sum and cooking it!

We ordered quite a few things, and loved all of them. The crab meat soup dumplings are quite unique, and live up to the hype. The shrimp har gow are packed with shrimp, and a substantial dumpling to eat on their own. My fiancÃ©e loved the Sumai, and we both thoroughly enjoyed the baked barbecue pork buns (so fluffy!). The spare ribs were perfect over steamed rice. The last dim sum dish that we ordered was the steamed egg custard buns, which was fluffy and sweet, and the perfect end to our meal. Our meal was definitely not cheap, but we loved it!!","Food - Crab Meat Soup Dumplings (unique and delicious), Shrimp Har Gow (packed with shrimp), Baked BBQ Pork Buns (fluffy), Spare Ribs (perfect over steamed rice), Steamed Egg Custard Buns (fluffy and sweet)||Ambiance - Well-decorated||Service - Friendly and attentive "
Qi Austin,"We went in for Dim Sum on a Sunday and it wasn't terribly busy.  When I looked online for a group of 4 around 10 am, there were only availability for 1230 and 230. However, when I called the restaurant, there appears to be more availbiity. So tip: call the restaurant if you don't see the time you want. Now on to the most important part... the FOOD.

We ordered:
SautÃ©ed Baby Bok Choy - Good. Nothing to write home about.
Spare Ribs with Black Bean Sauce - Very good. This dish can sometimes get a little too salty but this was perfect.
Pork and Shrimp Sui Mai - Good size and tasty.
Shanghai Soup Dumpling - Didn't have and but was told by my compadre that it was good.
Chicken Taro Egg Roll - Good. Didn't notice the taro. Not crazy about the plum sauce it comes with but my friend said it was good.
Baked BBQ Pork Bun - Don't care for. We all agreed we weren't too crazy about this. It's sweet and I prefer my meals savory.
Shrimp Har Kaw - Good. Not too salty.
Pan Fried Beef Bao - Don't care for. Another one I'm not super crazy about, I prefer the traditional bao. This was flat like a moon cake.

The service was great. The waitress was quick to fill our waters.

Parking - there's a Whole Foods garage you can park at around the corner.

I look forward to going back and trying out other food.","Food - Sauted Baby Bok Choy (good), Spare Ribs with Black Bean Sauce (very good), Pork and Shrimp Sui Mai (good), Shanghai Soup Dumpling (didn't have but was told was good), Chicken Taro Egg Roll (good), Baked BBQ Pork Bun (don't care for), Shrimp Har Kaw (good), Pan Fried Beef Bao (don't care for), Baked BBQ Pork Bun (don't care for), Pan Fried Beef Bao (don't care for)||Service - Great||Parking - Available||Location - near Whole Foods "

Qi Austin,"Horrifically overpriced food that is much less than sub par. Our appetizer were the hot and sour soup and charshu, but both were unimpressive in size and flavor. The soup was not tangy enough and lacking in spices. In my opinion, the sesame oil was also much too overpowering and the soup was obviously too starchy. What they called charshu were really  just five pieces of overly sweet and gamy pork, with a piece of cilantro placed on top for garnish. The crispy Sui Mai was the best dish overall, although it would have tasted much better without the mayo based sauce that had been drizzled on top. The shrimp Har gow was neither good nor bad. The shrimp had a nice texture but there wasn't anything overly impressive about this dish. Perhaps the dish with the oddest flavor that I couldn't quite put my finger in were the Shanghai Soup dumplings. I did not like how thick the Dumpling skin was, as I felt like I was getting too much dough to filling ratio. It was shockingly sweet with a bitter aftertaste and a mild wine-like flavor encompassing the soup inside. Once the General T'so's chicken arrived the entire meal went downhill. I would have much rather paid significantly less for orange chicken at Panda Express that would've been much more satisfactory taste wise. It was much too syrupy and sweet, like they had decided to cover up their lack of culinary expertise with an extreme amount of sugar. The dish also came out with no rice, which had to be purchased seperately. Speaking of the rice, my seven year old sister can make better rice than the chefs here can. I got bits of uncooked rice in between grains of mushy ones, and the entire dry bowl was a confusing cacophony of textures that did not belong together.

The two last dishes to come out where the mustard greens and the seafood delight with bird's nest. The mustard greens were overly salted and there was no presence in the flavor of the garlic slices that were spread amongst the mustard leaves. When I came to the seafood delight, the first thought that came to mind was that it tasted like the ocean- and not in a pleasant way. My tastebuds were assaulted with a sauce that tasted like a gallon of saltwater had been added to it. There were no other flavors there, no spices, and no depth. Just an overwhelming amount of salt. The bird's nest part of the dish was made of taro, and my only complaint was that it was a bit too thick. I believe it would have been much more pleasant to eat if it was thinner and crispier. Thankfully this wasn't salted as well, otherwise I wouldn't have been able to swallow. Towards the end of my meal I decided to try some of the octopus in the dish, as I do enjoy seafood. This turned out to be a huge mistake, which I found out shortly after biting into the small octopus's head. The texture was disgustingly mushy yet chewy at the same time, and as I bit into it a mouthful of salty water gushed into my mouth. It was the most unpleasant experience I have ever had eating seafood, and I have eaten a lot of seafood.

Now as far as price goes, we were a group of six so the price is generally going to run higher no matter where we go. But our bill ran out to $200, which was absolutely unacceptable for the quality of food and the level of satisfaction we received.

The service was polite, speedy, and considerate. I had no qualms with our server or hostess. However, I can say without a doubt that we will not be visiting establishment with tastelessly cooked and overpriced food again.","Food - Egg rolls (nice fry), Shrimp Panang Curry (started great but got sweeter, needed some acid to balance sweetness), Vegetable curry (started great but got sweeter, needed some acid to balance sweetness)||Menu - Huge"", Example 2 - ""Service - Great||Food - Chicken Tikka Masala (nice and spicy), Lamb Biryani (aromatic and flavorful)||Drinks - Mango Lassi (refreshing), Masala Chai (aromatic)"", Example 3 - ""Food - Sushi (fresh and delicious), Ramen (flavorful broth), Tempura (crispy)||Ambiance - Cozy and inviting||Service - Friendly and attentive"". <</SYS>> Below is the review on which you need to perform the task:

Qi Austin,"Came here with a group (4) of friends. We ordered several dumplings, entrees and drinks. Everything was great and we were really enjoying our time there. Our server was fantastic, friendly, ready with recommendations and attentive. After dessert we paid our tab and remained at the table a bit longer finishing our conversation. Out of nowhere a server we had not seen before rudely told us we had to leave since they needed the table for a reservation. Mind you, we had just spent over $300. We all come from the business and understand the need to turn tables. However, the manner it was done was completely unacceptable. When speaking to the manager about the situation he was just as rude and could have cared less. Truly disappointing.

Qi Austin,"I stopped here at Qi during my everlasting hunt for soup dumplings and roasted duck. Turns out this place has both! With a traditional details with a bit of modern flair, Qi brings the best of both worlds in not just it's food but also it's vibe and atmosphere.

Atmosphere: The overall design of the place has the feeling of fancier up scale place, with a bit more of a homely design with the traditional pictures and decor shown around the restaurant. I personally recommend a spot near the chefs where you can actually see them making dumplings as they are put out. Brings a sort of family and community feeling to the place.

Food: I ended up ordering both the soup dumplings and the roasted duck (surprise surprise). To my delight I was glad to see the chef's little addition to both dishes while still maintaining a familiar style. The soup dumplings come with a tasty vinegar sauce that just meshes so well when combining the flavors of the already savory dumplings. The roast duck however is the biggest winner in my books. Coming with an assortment of sauces and bao buns, the combination of all along with the duck just made for quite the savory experience. Salted evenly and not too greasy, the duck is certainly no joke.

Service: Again another easy win. My server was just such a delight and she easily helped me pick and choose from the perspective of a first time user.

Overall: Certainly an easy winner if you are looking for a more modern take on Chinese food. The service, presentation, and quality tempts me to return once again to try other things on the menu. Of course also a great place to get your soup dumpling fix, they are just soup-er.","Food - Soup Dumplings (tempts), Roasted Duck (winner)||Ambiance - Modern with traditional details||Service - Delightful "
Qi Austin,"Qi Austin is owned by Lin Asian Bar. The owner and chef are both from Shanghai. The brother in law host/manager is from Singapore. He's a hoot. We were able to walk in and get seated at the bar. Normally you need to call in or book online for reservations. The restaurant and bathroom were really clean.

The har kow appetizer was delicious.  I liked the dipping sauce as it was similar to how my uncle makes it. The crab corn soup was just OK. I wouldn't order it again. It wasn't particularly tasty or sweet.

A lot of the items on their menu are gluten free, anything that's battered and fried like their pecan shrimp. I didn't order their pecan shrimp but there were several entrees that caught my eye. I'll definitely be back to try some entrees!","Food - Har Kaw (Delicious), Crab Corn Soup (Not particular tasty or sweet)||Ambiance - Clean||Service - Friendly and hoot||Menu - Gluten-free||Location - Austin, TX "
Qi Austin,"Me and my husband loved the food and the service was great and so friendly. An absolute must try. We had only appetizers, but it was enough to fill us both up.
The shanghai soup dumplings (not pictured because i got too excited and ate them!) were my favorite. The broth was flavorful, the pork was tender, the dough was soft and perfectly thin.
The Zha Jiang Noodles reminded us both of a spaghetti dish but without the tomato sauce. The noodles alone are plain, but the pork/sauce it comes with makes the whole dish come alive! The seasoning was a little mild, but delicious and the fatty pork meat gave the dish everything it needed to be a great saucy noodle dish. It is hearty and filling. It lacks some salt but I personally didn't miss it and it has a very faint, almost undetectable kick to it as well.
The pan seared basil chicken dumplings were crispy, hot, and fresh! You can certainly taste the basil and the chicken itself is well seasoned but it is on the mild side. The texture on these dumplings are fantastic because of the crispy dumpling wrapped around the juicy chicken.
Lastly, and my husband's favorite, were the pan fried Akaushi beef bao's. These are like little pillows or clouds gently cradling the tender and juicy beef inside of them. They were so good, we would have ordered more had we not stuffed ourselves with the other delicious appetizers prior.
Everything we had, we 100% recommend!","Food - Shanghai Soup Dumplings (flavorful broth, tender pork), Zha Jiang Noodles (plain noodles, alive with pork and sauce), Pan Seared Basil Chicken Dumplings (crispy, fresh, mild seasoning), Pan Fried Akaushi Beef Bao's (like little pillows, juicy beef)||Service - Friendly and great||Ambiance - Modern and inviting "
Qi Austin,"I adore Qi. The food, the service, the cocktails, the Shanghai soup dumplings OMG.

For my second visit, I went with a group of friends to celebrate my birthday, and dinner there was truly a special experience. The main dining room is warm, dark, and glow-y. It feels cozy, fancy, and comfortable all at the same time.

I like the family style ordering, too, since I always want to try a little bit of everything. DO NOT MISS the Shanghai soup dumplings. I've had soggy, mediocre versions of these delicacies here and there and Qi's version is a mic drop in comparison to any I've tried.

Other highlights of the dinner menu: Akaushi beef with green pepper, sesame chicken (again, put aside all the mediocre versions of this that you've had including the sad frozen Lean Cuisine via the work microwave. Guilty!), and truffle fried rice. The high quality of the farm-driven ingredients shine through every dish. Sauces that accompanied dishes were not afterthoughts -- they complemented and rounded out the dishes in the best possible way.

Interestingly, the table fought the most over the sautÃ©ed pea shoots. They were killer!

All cocktails were beautifully balanced and also beautiful to look at. Our cocktail connoisseur crew tried nearly every one. Things that sound gimmicky, like the directive to bite the Szechuan flower contained within Tingling Electric Daisy, turn out to be really delightful.

The deliciousness of the desserts surprised me. Our server brought out the cutest little birthday hedgehog made out of lychee mousse. He was almost too adorable to eat. We also tried a special holiday item: a Christmas tree wrapped around delicious chocolate.

Our service got off to a slow start, but rallied quickly! The wait for food was virtually non-existent.

Definitely check out Qi. It is the classic/traditional Asian cuisine restaurant to beat in town.","Food - Shanghai Soup Dumplings (must-try), Akaushi Beef with Green Pepper (highlight), Sesame Chicken (highlight), Truffle Fried Rice (highlight), Sauted Pea Shoots (fighting over), Tingling Electric Daisy (gimmicky but delightful), Christmas Tree Wrapped in Chocolate (special holiday item)||Service - Slow start but rallied||Drinks - Beautifully balanced||Location - Dark, warm, glow-y||Menu - Family style "

Qi Austin,"Legitimately one of the best restaurants I've ever been to in Austin. My friends and I were impressed the moment we walked in to when we stepped out, and our waitress Emily (shoutout) was incredible and so attentive and sweet.

Qi pays attention to details. Everything about our experience was tailored and well thought out. The chopsticks have Qi branded on them, and all of the tables have Qi branded paper on them. The sauce bowls have little stone frogs, and I love that they give you tiny bowls for soup dumplings instead of soup spoons.

1. Soup dumplings - these were incredible. The broth is rich and flavorful, and the vinegar they give you is also yummy. I do wish there was a bit more meat inside of the soup dumplings because the filling is just that good, and I could order so many of these.

2. Shu mai - I'm not a fan of shu mai normally, but they do it so well. The pieces of shu mai are huge, and I love the little fish eggs that they put on top. It's seasoned wonderfully, and I would even say it's better than many dim sum places' I've been to before.

3. Har gow - Another dim sum dish that I'm not usually fond of, but Qi makes them so delicious. They also make each piece quite large, and they don't skip out on the shrimp either.

4. Truffle fried rice - Best. Fried. Rice. Ever. I swear, we all groaned when we took a bite. Don't let its looks fool you because it does seem quite plain, but it's legitimately one of the most flavorful and delicious fried rices I've ever eaten. I would come back and just order two whole bowls of this. It's seasoned so beautifully, and the smell is extremely aromatic.

5. Crab corn egg soup - I love corn soup, so I had to order this. It was really good, and I love the pieces of crab claws they put into the soup.

6. Seafood medley curry - I don't like curry, but this dish was pretty good. There was a good mix of seafood and vegetables, and the scallops, lobster, and clams were my favorite.

Make sure to order the things we got! We made a joke that Qi can't do any dish wrong because everything was so yummy. This place will definitely go on my list of Austin Favorites because our experience was so phenomenal. Emily came by multiple times to fill up water and ask if we needed anything, and she was such a lovely person as well. I will definitely come back again and try their sister restaurant!","Food - Soup Dumplings (Incredible broth, wish there was more meat), Shu Mai (Impressive, large pieces), Har Gow (Delicious), Truffle Fried Rice (Best.

Qi Austin,"Pros : Nice ambience, modern decor, free garage parking, quality food

Cons: way too expensive for dimsum dishes. All dishes are $10 and up.

While you are willing to pay for the ambience, the food it's not bad at all. If you can bear the bill, you will love it

If you are Asian and have been eating quality dimsum for way less and dont mind about the ambience, this could be too expensive for you.

With Austin demographic and scene, this type of restaurant is not surprising, just overpriced for good food.","Food - Dim Sum (expensive), Ambiance - Nice Modern Decor||Service - Friendly and attentive||Price - high "
Qi Austin,"Yeah, this place is great.

I'm still mourning the closure of New Fortune dim sum, so this place is a nice, upscale replacement.

No trolley dim sum, unfortunately, but some great options if you want to order off of a menu. Everything is pretty good, I think the lobster options are pretty pricey - but great if lobster is a must do for you!

Qi Austin,"Like everyone said, Qi is the sister site of Lin's and the fine dining atmosphere. If you're looking for some upscale dim sum during the afternoon, this is the place for you, though it can get pricey for the amount of food you get. You are essentially paying for the handmade dumplings and noodles, which is an experience.

The restaurant design is appealing with an exquisite bar area, I love the refined Asian design element and the interior is spacious with room to accommodate big parties. The one thing I would like to mention is the seating and tables aren't quite 6 ft apart. We were concerned when another party was seated at the countertop area right next to us.

Though, with handmade dumplings & noodles and upscale atmosphere, I can see myself bringing guests here to try because the restaurant is spacious.","Food - Dim Sum (handmade dumplings, noodles), Ambiance - Exquisite design, Appealing interior, Spacious||Seating - Not 6 ft apart||Price - high "
Qi Austin,"How did I live in Austin for this long before dining at Qi Austin? I can only be mad at myself for taking this long to visit.

I formally self-declare Qi as the BEST spot for Chinese food in Austin. Hands down, compared to all the ones that I've tried so far.

Soup Dumplings: These have got to be my favorite ones in town. Incredibly juicy, and wrappers are thin as can be - aka just the way I like 'em! You should probably order these if you want to truly enjoy your meal at Qi.

Tofu: **Chef's kiss** This dish was perfection. At first, I was hesitant to get this because a girl loves her meat. However, after the first bite, I wanted to take back every bad thing I have ever said about tofu. Seriously, beautifully soft fried tofu paired with a flavorful and rich sauce (perfect over rice).

Oxtail: Pretty tender but not quite there yet. The oxtail itself was a little disappointing. It was kind of tough and very small. The sauce greatly improved this dish because it was perfect with rice.

The inside is beautiful and romantic so don't opt for a patio seat unless your dumb like me. I will say that the service was a little spotty but it's probably because this place is always packed (good sign I guess).

Overall, I was really impressed with Qi. It's a little expensive when you first look at the menu but your mind will change after you try the food and experience Qi (ie. see the decoration, ambiance, dinnerware). You will see that the prices are very justified and definitely worth the visit!

P.S. it's pronounced ""Chi"" if you were curious!","Food - Soup Dumplings (favorite), Tofu (perfection), Oxtail (pretty tender but not there yet, disappointing), Menu - Expensive "
Qi Austin,"Qi is the sister restaurant to Lin's and if I were to describe her, she is the more refined and polished sister.  I really liked the Asian trinkets and details that went in to furnish the inside of the restaurant as it looked quite welcoming.  However, due to covid we chose to dine outside as we thought this was the safer choice.

Unfortunately, the way Qi spaces out the table is NOT ideal for distancing from others.  I am pretty sure we weren't 6 ft apart from other diners, and my chair was even back to back to the guy dining behind me.  Luckily, we both felt the discomfort and readjusted but there was only so much space to work with especially with the rain drizzling down on us.  We asked to move, but all the other outside tables were reserved for larger parties.  I totally understood, until I saw a guy sitting ALONE at a 4 top table...

We ordered 10 things in total for the night, and honestly only a few things stood out.  We started with a few Dim Sum Appetizers which by the way come in sets of 3 which is odd when dining as a couple.

Soup Dumplings: We ordered a serving of the Crab Meat Fish Mawl soup dumpling and the Shanghai soup dumpling.  You can tell these are all handmade which is great, texturally the inside is a rougher chop vs minced but the wrap was just too thick for me especially the tip.  The wrap actually overpowered the taste of the crab version despite being able to visually see the crab.  However I thought the filling and broth of the Shanghai version was good.

Scallop Caviar Sui Mai: I like how these were on the meatier side and enjoyed the addition of the truffle oil.  I also liked the ""caviar"", although it wasn't the traditional sturgeon, the fish eggs added a nice texture.

Pan Fried Akaushi Beef Bao: We only got this because our waitress said she eats this everyday, but I probably wouldn't.  It had a crispy bottom, tender inside, but lacked the juiciness from traditional pork.

Szechuan Peppercorn Alligator: I really enjoyed this dish, nice batter/fry and didn't taste super gamey.

Seafood Delight with curry sauce: The curry flavor was very rich and salty and the amount of seafood was disappointing in not only quantity but quality.  The only seafood that didn't taste overdone was the shrimp, which luckily they gave more than just a couple of pieces unlike the other seafood offerings.  The green onion pancake offered as a side was also poorly executed, as it was on the more dense side which was a bit doughy and quite greasy.  Also, the vegetables literally tasted like an afterthought as these weren't cooked.  Overall, I would definitely pass on this dish.

Singapore Crispy Whole Fish: You know how they say not to judge things by their outward appearance, well this was visually impressive, but taste wise a huge let down.  Honestly, as I was eating this dish I kept on trying to figure out what happened.  I couldn't tell if the fish was just not fresh, or was it over done or what, but everything about this fish definitely didn't warrant the $60 price tag.  Not only was the texture off but the batter didn't taste good and the sauce was odd, like watered down ketchup with a lot of raw onions...The only good thing about this dish was that you did get a good amount of Red Snapper meat since it's a whole fish.

Imperial Tofu: I love egg tofu so enjoyed how they used this type of tofu but the sauce paired with it wasn't my favorite.  However, I think they tried to mix it up a bit with the dry scallop which was a bit chewy.
 
SautÃ©ed Pea Shoot: Pretty standard preparation, $16.

Mango Bomb: I thought this was a pretty solid dessert, I enjoyed the flavor profile of the mango and the lychee as well as the powder which paired well with the chocolate from the edible spoon.

The night started off on a rocky start and ended just the same despite our waitress hoping that our experience improved by the end of the night. However, everything about this experience wasn't ideal, from getting rained on and unable to move to the lack of 6 ft space from others to the lovely serenade of construction sounds and bare minimum service.  Honestly, after a meal like this, it really made me miss the solid Asian food from Htown which not only delivers consistent quality but good quantity.  They also wouldn't charge you $2 for a small bowl of plain white rice although the truffle fried rice looked more appealing with the fresh shaved truffles.","Food - Crab Meat Fish Maw Soup Dumplings (good but thick broth), Shanghai Soup Dumplings (good but thick broth), Dim Sum Assortment(good), Scallop Caviar Sui Mai (liked), Pan Fried Akaushi Beef Bao (not good), Szechuan Peppercorn Alligator (good), Seafood Delight with curry sauce (rich and salty, disappointing quantity and quality), Singapore Crispy Whole Fish (visually impressive but disappointing taste), Imperial Tofu (loved egg tofu but disliked sauce), Pea Shoots (standard preparation), Mango Bomb (solid dessert)||Service - Lovely but minimal||Ambiance - Welcoming but lacked proper spacing||Price - high "

Qi Austin,"Qi fills in for Austin's lack of good dim sum with tasty XLB and har gow dumplings, and is also a great place to have a quiet and intimate weekday lunch.

My friend and I stopped by for lunch around 12:15pm on a Wednesday and were nervous about not getting seated because there weren't any more reservation slots on Resy. Thankfully, the place had plenty of tables available when we arrived, so we were seated automatically.

Qi's full dim sum menu is only available on the weekends, and they have a limited selection of dim sum ""appetizers"" on both the lunch and dinner menus on the weekday. Our waitress told us that we could still order anything from the dinner menu if we wanted, but opted to just split some of the dim sum dishes for a lighter lunch.

We ordered the har gow, XLB (Shanghai soup dumpling/xiao long bao), scallop siu mai, chicken Thai basil dumplings, and two egg drop soups so we could each have our own.

The egg drop soup was thick and delicious, though not as big of a serving as I would've hoped for $5. The XLB and har gow were totally worth it, though. As some of the most iconic dim sum dishes, Qi really does them justice! What I love about their soup dumplings is that the wrapping isn't super thick, which can often lead to goopy and overly doughy bites.

The chicken Thai basil dumplings were just okay; it tasted like a mild chicken Kra pow in a semi-crispy dumpling form. You could really taste the freshness in all the ingredients for everything we ordered though.

Since Qi is located at the bottom of a fancy office building on ritzy W 6th Street,  parking can be hard to come by. That's why I think it's a great weekday lunch spot because it's less crowded in that area during that time. But I'd still definitely come back for the dim sum brunches on the weekends if I were you!","Food - Har Gow (good), Shanghai Soup Dumpling (good), Scallop Sui Mai (okay), Chicken Thai Basil Dumplings (just okay), Egg Drop Soup (thick and delicious, small portion), Xiao Long Bao (good)||Location - Bottom of fancy office building||Parking - Hard to come by||Service - Friendly and helpful "

Qi Austin,"Another Modern Asian restaurant located in Downtown Austin with essentially the same offerings. We came in to celebrate the lunar new year, and FYI: if you're coming in to celebrate, book reservations way way in advance, as most of the patrons that night were just out for a casual dinner. To celebrate, we stuck with the traditional/modernized foods to promote longevity and wealth. We ordered the Shanghai Soup Dumplings, Scallop Caviar Sui Mai, Pan Seared Basil Chicken Dumplings, Hakka Veggie Noodles, and the Steamed Halibut with shredded chili. Per usual, the dumplings and shumai tasted great, but not worth its price. The Scallop Caviar Sui Mai sounded like it would taste exceptionally out of this world, but as soon as it arrived, it looked and tasted just like other shumais. Unfortunately, the Steamed Halibut was the least flavorful dish of the night. Very, very bland, even with the addition of the sauce and beautiful toppings.","Food - Shanghai Soup Dumplings (great), Scallop Caviar Sui Mai (not good), Pan Seared Basil Chicken Dumplings (good), Hakka Veggie Noodles (good), Steamed Halibut with shredded chili (very bland)||Price - high "
Qi Austin,"Another great high end authentic Chinese restaurant that isn't just about food but it's about the experience, the ambience, the music, the feel, and then the superb chinese cuisine.

The menu is short and simple but is full of flavors that you can appreciate the technique that is put into it. An example is the braised ox tail, to have the fatty, rich, deep dark soy flavors meshed with the gelatinous fat, it takes hours to make (I know it does, I've made it before). We ordered a few dim sum dishes but also ordered, salt n pepper tofu (love the big tofu chunk squares), walnut shrimp that were bigger sized similar to colossal shrimp with sliced pear, braised ox tail, and the alligator hot and peppers Szechuan style. For those that are not used to Szechuan style, it has a numbing taste to it and I appreciate the numbing when you eat all the rich foods, it somewhat cleans your pallet.

The decor and dining room takes you to another place, very interesting location with parking that has to be at Whole Foods (don't tell anyone) :).","Food - Braised Ox Tail (fatty, rich, deep dark soy flavors), Salt n Pepper Tofu (love the big tofu chunk squares), Walnut Shrimp (bigger sized, similar to colossal shrimp with sliced pear), Alligator Hot and Peppers Szechuan Style (has a numbing taste, cleans palate)||Location - Interesting||Parking - Convenient||Menu - Short and simple||Ambiance - Decor takes you to another place "
Qi Austin,Great for any wanting authentic dim sum and awesome service. Available parking downtown which is a plus,"Food was great! We ordered harrow, xis mai, bbq buns, chicken, shrimp pecan, cilantro shrimp dumplings, zhajianmein and a lobster filled dumpling. My favorite was the har gow and the soup dumplings. I did not care for the salt and pepper shrimp or the egg drop soup. Overall a very good experience will be back. The place had beauty decorations everywhere from lanterns to robes and umbrellas. The chairs were comfortable and the tables are pushed together a bit so if you are claustrophobic this may not be the spot for you. There was also a small stage with entertainment. [/INST]"
Qi Austin,"Pretty cool Chinese fusion spot in Austin!

It has a formal feel to it and I would recommend trying to snag a reservation- it wasn't busy when we got here for lunch but then got super packed! Offers indoor and outside seating. Dim sum and dumplings were definitely worth stopping by. The nailed the soup dumplings (lots of hot liquid). Their Jasmin tea went well with the lunch as well.

It's definitely got the price to match the ambiance but the food and service didn't leave me with a bad taste in my mouth. I'd imagine this place would be killer for a date night.","Food - Dim Sum (worth stopping by), Soup Dumplings (nailing it), Ja [/INST]"
Qi Austin,"I am visiting from Vancouver Canada. We have many good Chinese restaurants. However this was top of the list of all the good Chinese restaurants I have been in Vancouver. Food was very good, the atmosphere felt like being in China and very beautiful decorated and historic painting and clothing displayed. Service was very good staff friendly",very professional. Good I live far from it or I would be putting lots of money there. Highly recommend it. Very happy with the experience. The soup dumplings were delicious as well as the pickle platter and the salt and pepper prawns. The chicken xiao long bao was very tasty. The truffle rice was amazing. I ordered the Peking duck but did not eat it. I was so impressed with the foie gras and the sauce that came with it I didn't need the duck. I highly recommend it. I will be back. [/INST]
Qi Austin,"Stopped by for dim sum brunch and made a same day reservation on Resy. The place seemed to be at distanced capacity.

Highlights were the scallop caviar sui mai, lobster dumplings and Shanghai soup dumplings. I like the variety available compared to Lin, although they did run out of one of our items.

Qi Austin,"Absolutely delicious meal except for 1 dish.

Firstly, I like the ambiance of this place way more than Lin's. It's perfect for various nights out - work dinner / family or in-laws night out / date night / girls night! It fits it all!
Parking is easy peasey at either the Whole Foods lot or the parking lot right behind Qi on floor 4.
Meal:
- Shanghai Soup Dumplings: comes as an order of 5. These are delicious!
- Crabmeat Soup Dumplings: comes as an order of 5. These are also delicious!
- Pan Fried Beef Baos: comes as an order of 3 and was really tasty - never had them pan fried so this is different.
- Sesame Chicken: really tasty and perfect for any picky eater! Does not come with rice
- Salt and Pepper Shrimp: they actually only have the salt and pepper lobster tail or tofu but I asked them if they could do the shrimp and he happily obliged and this was yummy and spicy and perfectly lightly battered and fried.
- Truffle Mushroom fried rice: omggggg so good and perfectly seasoned and just the right amount of truffle flavor
- Seafood pan fried noodles: the only disappointment of our meal. Absolutely awful. The noodles are so starchy and the broth was just not appetizing at all. Really wish we had not ordered this but all the other items made up for it.

The cocktails were also all excellent and I'm picky with mine bc a lot of restaurants don't know how to make a good one or it's too sweet and this was awesome.

Qi Austin,"We had a lovely Friday date night here this past weekend. I made reservations (like when they opened, but I was OK with that) and it was really nice...not too busy yet. Our waitress was really attentive and answered any questions we had and had some great suggestions. I highly recommend the Scallop and Caviar Sui Mai - like...wish I had ordered 2 of these!! Probably the best Sui Mai I've ever eaten. One of the driving factors of our visit is they had Peking Duck! I haven't had that since a trip to Beijing a few years ago and was wanting to try that again, plus the hubby had never tried it. That was a fun experience - they use bao buns instead of the thin pancakes I remembered, but loved it just the same! We both MMM'd our way through the meal. We'll be back for sure, there were too many things we didn't get to try this round. ;)

Qi Austin,"I give a very rare 5.  Let's start with the wait staff, friendly and very informative (shout out to Danny).  The menu was fantastically overwhelming but based on Danny's really enthusiasm for the restaurant we let him steer the ship. Started with the Soup Dumplings,  Amazing.  I realized in all my travels, maybe I never experienced a true, fresh dumpling. A MUST HAVE.  The Shumai with truffle was good.  Appreciated dipping it in my dumpling sauce.  Pork bun...little meat but the freshness and tenderness of the bun made it a 5.

Now to the entree...The salt and pepper lobster was FAN-FUKING tastic.  Incredibly tender, subtle but with a great taste and texture.  The truffle fried rice is a light nice, subtle taste, not worth the upgrade for the truffle shavings.  The highlight of that was the waiter coming out to shave it.  Never had ""fresh truffle', you can pay a cheap upgrade here to scratch that it and then do a mi drop.

Qi Austin,"I was a very underwhelmed and disappointed by the food, especially given the prices. All 3 of the dim sums we ordered tasted very similar - the scallop, the shrimp(soup dumplings), and lobster. The Truffle fried rice was bland and had little to no taste of truffle. The pea shoots were good, but nothing special. The salt/pepper lobster was tasty but the lobster was a bit tough. I went in with really high expectations given all the praise, but was quite disappointed. Maybe I chose the wrong dishes. I'm willing to try again, but next time I'll skip the dim sum.
The best things about the place were the atmosphere (especially the bathrooms!), and the great waiter.","Food - Dim Sum (similar tasting, could be skipped), Truffle Fried Rice (bland, lacked flavor), Pea Shoots (good but not special), Salt/Pepper Lobster (tasty but tough), Lobster Dumplings (tasted like scallop), Shrimp( soup dumplings)||Ambiance - Great||Service - Great||Price - high "
Qi Austin,"Went here for my birthday dinner because im a personal fan of Asian and Chinese food! Thought about going to several other places but decided on here because it seemed more up-scale. We scheduled a reservation for 5 people ahead of time and when we got there service was amazing! We had to double check with non-alchoholic drinks, but after we were settled we orded 3 sets of dumplings, and an entree item each, (About $60 per person) which were great! Personal favs from the table were the Shanghai Soup Dumplings, Steamed Lovster Dumplings, and the SautÃ©ed Mustard Green. I personally got the Salt and Pepper Lobster Tail, and it was amazing! There are amazing flavors and seafood, comfortable service, but what else? Personally, i thought the resturant was a little loud, but we went at 6:00- and the resturant was packed.

Qi Austin,"I almost don't want to write this review so y'all won't know how good this place is so I can still get a reservation!!

Regardless, I am a woman of the people and will share my thoughts.

Qi is an incredible addition to the Austin food scene. I tried dinner and dim sum in the same week because I have no self control .

Dinner was wonderful. We had dumplings, pea shoots, and truffle rice. But the real star of the show was the Peking duck. The meat was juicy and the skin was crispy.

Brunch was on another level. I declared that both the crab and regular soup dumpling were the best I've ever had in Austin. My friends who live in NY and are dumpling heads agreed. Curry beef puffs. Salt and pepper shrimp . Chao shao. Scallion pancake curry dip. Pickle platter - with jellyfish! Steam bbq pork bun.

Everything was INCREDIBLE. We've already made some standing reservations to return. Thank you Qi for adding some amazing cuisine to Austin's food scene.","Food - Peking Duck (Juicy Meat, Crispy Skin), Dumplings (Best Crab and Regular Soup Dumplings, Curry Beef Pups, Salt and Pepper Shrimp, Chao Shao, Scallion Pancake Curry Dip, Pickle Platter (Jellyfish), Steam BBQ Pork Bun)||Location - 601 West 6th Street||Service - Incredible||Ambiance - Amazing "
Qi Austin,"A couple of weeks ago I came in for lunch. I was dining solo; so sharing and ordering multiple dishes was not an option; BUMMER. I typically like going with the wife and try 4 or 5 items to share and take home.

The restaurant was very nice. Not ur typical Chinatown decor, but it was certainly an upscale and relaxing space. Seems like a large mural behind the bar. High ceilings. Plenty of indoor and outdoor dining. Very good service. Open kitchen.

I ordered lobster dumplings and pork soup dumplings. Both were very nice. The lobster was firm and fresh. Got the impression they prepare to order. Lite in flavor, but still tasty. A bit pricy for 3 dumplings at $15.

Soup dumplings came five to an order. Very traditional preparation and again lite in flavor; but tasty. I couldn't tell if it was pork or chicken. I ordered pork dumplings.

Overall, it was a pleasant lunch experience. While I was not wow by the food. It was good. It was tasty. The service was excellent. It just wasn't my Flushing Chinatown NYC experience. It was more of an upscale restaurant serving Chinese food. Nothing wrong with this overall. CC friendly. Street parking.

I would certainly return with the wife at a future date...

Qi Austin,"As a Cantonese person, I was surprised that a dim sum place doesn't offer free tea. They only had one choice of tea (jasmine) and it was charged per cup, despite the fact that there was one pot of tea brought to the table.

The dim sum dishes were good quality, especially the har gow, which was perfect texture - comparable to the dim sum I've had in Hong Kong.

It is an expensive restaurant, prices per dish is about double the price at a normal Cantonese dim sum eatery.

Impressively hardly a bite went uneaten. Everything tasted great, came out very quickly, and made for a good dining experience.

Pros:

Place deserves it! Excellent Chinese cousin with even furnitures reminding of ancient, Asian authenticity. Enjoyed the food and even some Chinese beer on tap.
Tried to stay light late at night with Seasonal Vegetable with Birds Nest which was so delicious that had to crack on the nest. Imperial Tofu has to be eaten fresh, while still crispy that will blow your mind how creamy and tasty this thing can be. Now the real reminder of authenticity was the Spicy Chicken with Pine Nuts that has some bite to it forcing to continue eating. Next time will absolutely be the Szechuan Peppercorn Alligator.

Qi Austin,"Overall very good experience. The restaurant is nicely decorated and they have free parking in the garage of the building.  Most of the items we ordered were good but my favorite was the sea cucumber ha cao.  We also had the chicken feet, siu mai, ha cao, pea shoots, seafood soup dumplings, curry beef puff and the scallion pancake. The 2 dishes that I would not reorder would be the beef puff due to lack of flavor and the scallion pancake. It just wasn't as exciting to eat.  We would definitely dine here again.","Food - Sea Cucumber Hà Carp (favorite), Chicken Feet (good), Egg Rolls (good), Shrimp Panang Curry (started great but got sweeter, needed some acid to balance sweetness), Vegetable curry (started great but got sweeter, needed some acid to balance sweetness)||Ambiance - Nicely decorated||Parking - Free||Service - Friendly and attentive "
Qi Austin,"Okay, so I'd heard about this place from a few of my friends, so I knew I had to visit. I visited alone for lunch, so I had to really resist over-ordering. But I still ended up ordering too much. But I was happily full!

Here's what I got:
- sauteed pea shoot: I got this because I needed some veggies. Pretty good, maybe too salty.
- Shanghai soup dumplings (5 pcs): A staple and a must at dim sum! Very good. I could eat these forever. Goes well with a hint of vinegar sauce they provide.
- Lobster dumpling (3 pcs): These I could've done without. The lobster was a little on the chewy side, the dumpling skin was too thick. Not my favorite.
- Baked BBQ pork bun (2 pcs): I got these because my waiter recommended them as his favorite. I would've done the steamed bbq pork buns otherwise. And I regretted that... While the baked buns were pretty delicious, I didn't quite enjoy the bread + pork combo. The pork was pretty delicious and sweet; great flavor!

So, the highlight of my meal was the soup dumplings! And those are hard to make well! I would go back just for their soup dumplings, maybe to try the steamed pork buns.

Their sister restaurant is called Lin - maybe I'll hit them up next time!","Food - Sauted Pea Shoots (pretty good, maybe too salty), Shanghai Soup Dumplings (very good, goes well with a hint of vinegar sauce), Lobster Dumpling (not good, chewy lobster, thick dumpling skin), Baked BBQ Pork Bun (delicious, prefer steamed pork buns), Lin's (sister restaurant, worth visiting)||Service - Recommendations||Location - Nearby||Menu - Huge "

Qi Austin,"We booked a reservation one week ahead with high chair in celebration of Chinese New Year. We came this morning with no high chair. They serve family style but not family friendly.

Qi Austin,"This place is definitely worth the hype+great reviews!

I recommend making a reservation beforehand to ensure you have a table because it does get pretty busy. Our waitress was extremely friendly and answered every question I had about the menu.

We started off with the soup dumplings which were so juicy&delicious. The zha jiang mian had a bit of a kick to it which made it amazing, and the seafood delight was the perfect combination of lobster, scallops, clams, mussels, and veggies. The curry sauce went so well with the crispy scallion pancake that it came with!!

The tingling cocktail was an interesting experience- you bite the flower first which numbs your tongue a little bit, then drink the cocktail. The numbing really brought out the citrus flavors of the drink.","Food - Soup Dumplings (Juicy & Delicious), Zha Jiang Noodle (Kick), Seafood Delight (Combination of Lobster, Scallops, Clams, Mussels, Veggies), Curry Sauce (Went well with Crispy Scallion Pancake), Tingling Cocktail (Interesting experience, numbed tongue, brought out citrus flavors)||Service - Extremely friendly||Ambiance - Nice and modern "
Qi Austin,"Of course I had to come here because Lin Asian is my husband and I's favorite restaurant. There are definitely some similarities in the menu, but I think the atmosphere is very different! They do have free parking in a parking garage attached, which is great for downtown. The service is always good, and I enjoyed the waiters recommendations the last time I went. We got the truffle egg fried rice, pan seared basil chicken dumpling, and spicy chicken with pinenuts. I didn't love the dumplings, but that's because I just should've stuck with my tried-and-true soup dumplings of theirs that I know is amazing! The other dishes were so good. I can't wait to come back. I'd highly recommend.","Food - Truffle egg fried rice (good), Pan seared basil chicken dumplings (not good), Spicy chicken with pinenuts (very good)||Location - Downtown||Parking - Free||Service - Good||Menu - Similar to Lin Asian "
Qi Austin,"AMAZING!!!!! A must try. We were so fortunate to get in. While touring Austin on scooters on a Sunday morning, we thought what better way to end our weekend trip than with dim sum.   The restaurant opened up at 10:30 and we were already waiting at the front door with 5-6 other parties. The host asked if we had reservations and since we didn't requested that our dine in experience be limited to 2 hours.

EVERYTHING was PHENOMENAL. We cannot wait to go back. From taste to presentation - five stars. The only picture I posted that may be labeled inaccurately were the shrimp and potato balls. I'm thinking they're just shrimp balls without the potatoes because I don't remember it having any potatoes in it.

I'm only stating this because when we ordered what we thought were our second round of salt and pepper shrimp, the ""true"" salt and pepper shrimp that came out was prepared totally  different than the shrimp balls (see pictures posted) Both were great and I would order again in a heart beat. In terms of taste, just imagine your typical dim sum 10 times better. Here, the dim sum is prepared made to order (hence no rolling food carts) and nothing is frozen (per our server). And she was right, the food tastes so fresh. It has this clean taste that you have to try to see what I'm talking about. The bok choy and snow pea shoots, yums! You can't say you've had dim sum unless you've had the shrimp and pork xiu mai and pork spare ribs. The surprise star dish that I wouldn't have ordered but was served because I had forgotten to scratch it off my dim sum list was the crispy sea cucumber har caw. It's shaped like an empanada and filled with deliciousness. Again, you just have to try it to. It's really hard to describe.

Also, we limit  going to dim sum because  many of the dishes  are  cooked with a lot of oil. Not here. I guess that's one of the reasons why I enjoyed the food so much at Qi, you don't feel gross after feasting. Sooooo order away.

Side note. In my opinion,  dim sum is better enjoyed/shared with a party of *three-four. It's like tapas. Everyone gets a taste  and you all get to try more dishes.

* you can have more people in your party, however, you would probably want to order 2 of most of the dim sum  dishes.","Food - Shrimp Har Kaw, Shrimp Sor Sor Egg Rolls, Pork and Shrimp Sui Mai, Pork and Shrimp Stuffed Eggplant, Crab Meat Corn Soup, Steam BBQ Pork Bun, Shanghai Soup Dumpling, Chicken Taro Egg Rolls, Cilantro Shrimp Dumpling, SautÃƒÂ©ed Baby Bok Choy, SautÃƒÂ©ed Baby Potatoes, Steam Lobster dumpling, Scallop Caviar Sui Mai, Dan Dan Noodle, Shrimp Stuffed Eggplant, Baby Bok Choy with Shrimp, Salt and Pepper Lobster tail, Flambeauau Everest Cheesecake||Menu - Huge||Service - Great||Ambiance - Nice "

Ambiance/ Aesthetic was tasteful and calming. Our server, Evan Y was fantastic. I'm gluten free and he was very diligent and tried his hardest to accommodate that.

My friend was trying Chinese for the first time, so they made her General Tso's chicken, even though it wasn't on the menu. Once again, Evan was so patient and kind.

A little pricey, but we had plenty to take home. You could easily split an entree here with someone if you get two sides of rice. Our share 2 entrees and an appetizer with 4 people and have plenty to eat.

Qi Austin,"I've been here twice in the last two weeks--first with an out-of-town friend and then with my parents. Qi has an upscale take on Dim Sum, and there is a lot to love about it.

As others have said before, this was not the typical Dim Sum experience with rolling food carts that you'd find in Houston or Dallas (or in NY or Boston chinatowns). Everything was made-to-order, which does add to the quality of the dishes served (you don't end up with some of the mushy-ness that sometimes happens with steamed dishes that have been on a cart for too long). And you also have the advantage of ordering cocktails to accompany your meal. Between both trips, however, I have found the dishes to be somewhat hit or miss for me. My favorite dishes have been the Crab Meat Meat Fish May Soup Dumpling, Scallop Caviar Sui Mai, Sauteed Baby Bok Choy, Sauteed Chinese Broccoli (they were out of Pea Shoots), and Shanghai Soup Dumpling. It's also notable that they do have off-menu offerings for vegetarians if you ask--my parents and I really enjoyed the Salt and Pepper Tofu.

As a random note, my friend also wanted me to mention the fancy self-sanitizing toilets in the bathrooms.

All in all, I have enjoyed the food and the ambiance of Qi both times that I have been. My one quibble is that, for being one of the only Dim Sum options in Austin, it is on the pricy side; to be fair, though, it does offer the upscale dining experience to back up the prices.","Food - Crab Meat Meat Fish May Soup Dumpling (favorite), Scallop Caviar Sui Mai (favorite), Sauted Baby Bok Choy (favorite), Sauted Chinese Broccoli(good), Salt and Pepper Tofu(favorite), "

Qi Austin,"It was my birthday celebration. We arrived on time , ordered food and drinks , at one point we decided to order dessert. We called the server but instead of taking our order he told us our time is up!! He said you have a two hour limit per table and practically forced us out!!
At that moment we asked to talk to a manager. He's name is Jonny. Jonny bluntly told us about the two hours limit even though it wasn't specified on the reservation. He couldn't even show us where exactly does it say this type of "" policy"" .  He was rude and unprofessional with almost a smirk on his face.
Honestly, I am shocked that this could happen in what I thought was an upscale restaurant. Instead we were treated as it was an "" all you can eat buffet "" .After spending over $500 ,  You ruined my birthday and made our experience horrible!","Food - Egg rolls (nice fry), Shrimp Panang Curry (started great but got sweeter, needed some acid to balance sweetness), Vegetable curry (started great but got sweeter, needed some acid to balance sweetness)||Menu - Huge"", Example 2 - ""Service - Great||Food - Chicken Tikka Masala (nice and spicy), Lamb Biryani (aromatic and flavorful)||Drinks - Mango Lassi (refreshing), Masala Chai (aromatic)"", Example 3 - ""Food - Sushi (fresh and delicious), Ramen (flavorful broth), Tempura (crispy)||Ambiance - Cozy and inviting||Service - Friendly and attentive"". <</SYS>> Below is the review on which you need to perform the task:

Qi Austin,"Had a delightful lunch today at Qi.  It's a colorful, charming little place.  Since I was alone I sat at the bar and had the crab soup dumplings, lobster dumplings and scallops and caviar dumplings, along with the wild orchid cocktail.  All were quite good, though I've been spoiled by soup dumplings in Seattle.  While I noshed, they prepared my take out order: peppercorn alligator, truffle egg fried rice and imperial tofu.  Fried rice was good but my son said the Alligator was amazing and I was absolutely wowed by the tofu.  All the service staff were helpful and kind and my food arrived promptly.

Qi Austin,"Dim sum made a little fancy. If you're looking for the Ocean Palace in Houston experience with the pushed carts, you're not gonna find it here. Perhaps for people not familiar with that scene, it might be intimidating. But this place is just like a sit down restaurant where you can order things family style or entrees on their own. It's a beautiful place, definitely a great lunch or dinner restaurant for an event.

I took two other people here because they had a version of xiaolong bao without red meat. It was pretty friendly for people with that diet restriction, and all the cocktails were delicious. The Peking duck was also quite unique as it came with an interesting butter that I've never had before. Definitely a good vibe with friendly wait staff. Expect to pay a bit more, I paid about $55 for each person. I think for the ambience and the food actually being quite good, it's a justified price. I would recommend this place especially to young professionals craving good asian food!","Food - Xiao long bao (friendly fat), Peking duck (unique butter), Dim Sum (beautiful presentation, not traditional push cart), Cocktails (delicious)||Ambiance - Beautiful||Price - high "

Qi Austin,"We ordered:
Fried rice with egg and truffle
Xiao long bao pork and seafood
Taro egg roll
Sui Mai
Har gaw
Potstickers
Peking duck

Xiao long bao is a must. I would get the pork one times 2 over the seafood one. Sui Mai is also good. It's not the traditional pork and shrimp sui Mai but it was really well done with a hint of truffle. The fried rice was good, but not worth the price. There was hardly any egg and truffle. They could've at least added more onions or SOMETHING and not just literally grains of rice. Taro egg roll was okay. I would pass on this next time because there was hardly any taro and I definitely didn't taste any chicken in it. The Peking duck was cooked perfectly. I've never had duck so tender with such a crispy skin. Potstickers were pretty bland and I would pass on them next time as well. I was also pretty impressed with the har gaw considering how much dim sum I've eaten in my life. They were huge and packed super well.

All in all, it was a good experience. I would go back for the xiao long bao. I've been to Lin's before and for some reason did not like them then. I assume they are the exact same things. Perhaps it was the person I was with that soured the experience and food, but I definitely recommend the XLB here at Qi.

Qi Austin,"Came here for the first time on my birthday with my boyfriend and I was pleasantly surprised. I knew their food was going to be good based on visiting their sister restaurant Lin in the past but I'm pretty geeked about their honey lychee pork and their truffle fried rice. There was also a cocktail, who's name I forgot but I know it had coconut and beets in it, which was amazing. I could probably drink a few of those and just be in heaven. Their dumplings were of course very yummy as well. For dessert we had what they offered for birthdays which was this cute little hedgehog raspberry chocolate truffle and that was not only cute but of course yummm.

Let's talk service. So the service was great! Can't remember our waitresses name but she was awesome, very friendly and attentive.

Aesthetics? They have em. You can come here dressed up and dressed down and not feel out of place. With cute details like cranes, umbrellas and accent pillows you can definitely bring your out of towners and introduce your in towners to this semi new restaurant.","Food - Honey lychee pork, Truffle fried rice||Service - Great||Ambiance - Cute details||Drinks - cocktail with coconut and beets||Dumplings - Yummy||Birthday dessert - Cute hedgehog raspberry chocolate truffle||Menu - Huge "

Qi Austin,"Very good, excellent service. Had the dim sum exclusively and was very pleased. The buns were very good and the taro eggrolls","were unexpectedly delicious. The scallion pancakes were more like little cornbread mice, but they were still very tasty. The Peking duck was fantastic and came with a pate you spread across the bao for flavor. I wish the tables were a bit bigger since their dim sum dishes are so damn good, I would love to try the whole chicken and the crispy chicken turnovers. The deserts looked amazing but we did not try them. I will definitely come back when I visit Austin again! [/INST]"
Qi Austin,"The aesthetic and decorations of this restaurant are stunning! This is related to Lin restaurant, so they had very similar dishes and renditions of food to be honest. I went here for dim sum brunch and the service wasn't that great. Our waiters weren't friendly and didn't seem happy. My favorites were the scallop and caviar sui mai - it was cooked perfectly as the sui mai was tender and soft, and the Chao Shou. Overall, the food was overpriced and redundant. I've been to Lin and Wu Chow and felt like they were very similar, so the food wasn't worth it to me.

Our favorites were: shrimp stuffed Chinese eggplant, shrimp Har gow, pork and shrimp sui mai, Shanghai soup dumplings, pan fried beef bao.

We also have tried the lobster dumpling, crispy turnip cake, Chao shou, curry beef puff, baked bbq pork bun, and spare ribs and liked it all. It really comes down to how much room we have in our tummies.

I'm giving five stars for the service. our servers were super attentive and accommodated us so well. they were friendly and explained each dish, giving us fun tidbits here and there. we had a large party and they handled it well.

We ordered a lot of dishes and the standout ones for me were the Shanghai soup dumplings, shrimp har gow, scallop siu mai, chicken feet, and steam egg custard bun.

Qi Austin,"Ohh my gosh, this place was amazing.

As a pescatarian, there were plenty of options: crab meat fish maw soup dumpling, shrimp har gaw, salt and pepper tofu, bird's nest, and truffle fried rice. The crab soup dumpling was amazing, and I would definitely come back to get it. Shrimp har gaw was pretty standard, good but not mind-blowingly amazing, especially when compared to the other dishes. The salt and pepper tofu had a crispy, well-seasoned outside and was delicious. Truffle fried rice does have a deep flavor but it's mainly rice (there's maybe one egg in the whole dish) and so IMO it's not worth the $18 price tag, unless you really enjoy truffle.

Since I came for my birthday, we ordered their birthday dessert, which is a cute chocolate mousse hedgehog filled with an icy raspberry filling (they have other animals too!). The two flavors paired wonderfully together, though it did look a bit gory when digging into the lil hedgehog haha.

The secret real treat is the bathroom. Beautiful cave-like vibe, contrasted with a fancy toilet that automatically lifts its seat up for you, and oh my gosh, the paper towels. I wanted to take them home, they felt so good lol.

Qi Austin,"The Shanghai Soup Dumplings are very, very juicy and delicious! So are the Lobster Dumplings. The dumpling wrap's texture is extremely silky and tender. I would go back just for the these dishes. However, the dumplings are the only two items I would recommend. We were rather disappointed about the Steamed Halibut and Truffle Egg Rice because they tasted extraordinarily bland. The Szechuan Peppercorn Alligator (fried nuggets) is not bad if you have strong taste buds for Szechuan's famously spicy dishes. The service was great. Everyone working at the restaurant was wearing masks. Our table was right outside the kitchen entrance and right next to the register... other than that, I think the overall experience was good.

Qi Austin,"Pickled plate was amazing! Just the right amount of fresh crunch in every bite! Alligator was good but not much flavor considering the Szechuan title, was expecting much more flavor and spice. Now, the dumplings are absolutely perfect and delicious....although the variety is limited; every bite was incredible. Reminiscent of old family dinners. The snow pea greens were really good too. Was disappointed the mango cake dessert was sold out and although the one we got was really pretty it was just a pricy piece of candy but overall a good experience. The thing that really took away the one star was the alligator and had to keep hailing down someone to get refills on hot water. (Seating is in close proximity so side note: customers who are not Asian-and saying it out loud so all other tables could be sure- explaining loudly what authentic asian cuisine is, how to properly consume, and coaching table etiquette next to ""Asian"" me who grew up with restaurant owners, please stop referring to Asia as a country/singular culture/etiquette!

Qi Austin,"Visiting the Austin area I came across this most fabulous and innovative restaurant.

I put my fate in the hands of my more than capable server, Dennis. He recommended the scallop shu mai and the Shanghai soup dumplings - his favorite items and I suspect the most popular items on the menu.

Taking my time to savor each dim sum, it was impossible to decide which was better, even though I had challenged myself to pick one as the winner.

Having finished both dishes I needed to try one more, just to make sure the first two weren't a fluke. The pot stickers came out a few minutes later and did not disappoint. Not only were they absolutely delicious, but were almost too beautiful to eat.

The pastry chef who was working in front of me in the kitchen suggested the rum raisin cheesecake. It was right on target. But before I could leave, I indulged myself with a second dessert - the mango bombe. One of the most creative and delicious sweets I've ever enjoyed.

This is a must-do when eating in Austin. I challenge anyone to find a superior restaurant!","Food - Scallop shu mai (favorite), Shanghai soup dumplings (favorite), Pot stickers (absolutely delicious, beautiful), Rum raisin cheesecake (on target), Mango bombe (creative, delicious)||Service - Impressive "
Qi Austin,All I have to say is WOW! I ordered the salt and pepper (?) lobster dish and it was super tasty as well as the sauteed pea shoots (an all-time favorite of mine when I go to Chinatown in Boston for Dim Sum).

Qi Austin,"Being that I had the day off, and being that Qi was open for lunch on this day, and had take out options, it was a perfect match for a new place to try.

So glad the stars aligned to try this today.  Ordering experience was easy through Toast.  I was a little confused about how to pick up the food, but my phone navigation led me right to a sign with a phone number to call for Qi Curbside.  I was directed to park in the adjacent parking ramp and come through the lobby to pick up my food.  The restaurant itself is well-appointed for its downtown location.  The bartended was busy, even at lunchtime, and the serving staff moved efficiently between kitchen and tables.  It looked like a lovely place to dine if you're willing to risk eating amongst others in an indoor space.

The food was packaged very well.  The salmon salad was packed in three separate containers:  leafy things and veggies in a box, salmon in its own container, and dressing in yet another container.  This kept the cold parts cold, warm parts warm, and allowed me to assemble the salad just before eating.  We also tried the hot and sour and egg drop soups and both were very good.  We also had the Spicy Chicken with Pine Nuts. The flavors were rich and the chicken tender.  One could control to some extent the spiciness of the dish by the number of dried chili pieces one chose to ingest.  

Thanks to Qi is for providing take-out options that travel well and gave me a holiday lunch treat.","Food - Salmon salad (very good, packaged well), Hot and Sour Soup (very good), Egg Drop Soup (very good), Spicy Chicken with Pine Nuts (rich and tender)||Ambiance - Well-appointed||Parking - Convenient||Service - Efficient, friendly "
Qi Austin,"What a beautiful spot for a Sunday Dim Sum Brunch.  As others have mentioned, this is run by the group behind Lin's further down on 6th Street near Clark's Oyster Bar.  We had a fabulous meal, excellent service and a beautiful patio/balcony setting on a Sunday with beautiful weather n April in Austin.  We started out with their mimosas with tangerine fancy.

Qi Austin,"I was in town on business and found this gem. I came twice within 3 days because it was so delicious. Sunday I came for dim sum. We ordered Shanghai Soup Dimplings, Seafood Soup Dimplings, Pea Shoots, Sticky Rice with Chinese Sausage, Beef Potstickers and a Coffee Martini. Today, I ordered the soup dumplings, pea shoots and pork loin in sweet & sour sauce. Service was excellent on both occasions and decor is amazing.

Qi Austin,"Delicious food and drinks! We went for dinner service and ordered the soup dumplings, basil chicken dumplings and beef bao appetizers. All of those were fantastic! Tried multiple drinks and enjoyed all of them. My husband and I shared an entry (honey beef) and noodles and bok choy. The only thing we wouldn't order again was the bok choy. It was good but we didn't love it for the $18 price tag.

As far as following covid precautions, we felt very safe. Every staff member we saw was properly wearing their masks. The kitchen staff was wearing masks and gloves and guests were required to wear a mask unless seated at their table.

Qi Austin,"This is my 2nd review of Qi... My 1st was spectacular! However, the 2nd visit wasn't so much. We brought my mother-in-law and wife here because we loved it so much the 1st time. Tonight's visit was very disappointing. The Peking Duck was super dry.... almost inedible. The Fried Chicken was the same... you had to drink water with it just to get it to go down (swallow). The dim sum was good, but it too seemed dry... The service was spectacular! I was just really disappointed with these ""yummy"" dishes that were so poorly executed. Also, on Saturday night, this should have been your true A-game.

We will go back to Qi in a few months, just because we had a great 1st experience. I just hope they can fix some of these issues so their food can be as spectacular as we know it can be!

My advice, if you try it and it's not good, let the wait staff know. I think the Chef will appreciate the feedback for sure. This place is too good not to be GREAT!","Food - Peking Duck (super dry), Fried Chicken (dry), Dim Sum (good but dry), Service - Spectacular||Ambiance - Great||Menu - Huge "

Qi Austin,"Arrived right before they were about to close for lunch and they were able to seat and serve us right away. The decorations are vibrant and fit the atmosphere the are trying to create.

Qi Austin,"I truly wanted to give this place a 5 stars...but in all fairness just can't. We went as soon as this place opened on a Sunday morning for our anniversary brunch. No reservations but got seated right away. Place was not busy yet...Waited a while before our waiter approached us to see about drinks. We ordered hot tea as that is our dim sum tradition. Our waiter didn't really say much to us and wasn't really making an attempt to be engaging...fine, gave him our order on a piece of paper that you check off which is no big deal. Then we wait...almost 10 minutes goes by and tables next to us were starting to get food and still no tea. Looked around and front house manager or maybe owner was just standing around, our waiter was ""busy"" behind the service station and not paying attention to us trying to get his attention. Again, not attentive. When we finally flagged him down about the tea he says oh we are still boiling water. What??? How can a Dim Sum place not have hot water ready for tea?? Come on.
Food started to arrive and I must say the quality was very good and the ingredients used were top notch. The service did pick up once other service staff started to come around to grab used plates and so it did improve. We definitely loved the truffle fried rice (which I had to reorder because our waiter didn't put it in). The chicken feet had cold spots which means it wasn't heated thoroughly. The sea cucumber dumplings was epic! Definitely recommend. But couple other things were disappointing...like the sticky rice with sausage which was just sticky rice with tiny bits of sausage in there. The baked bbq pork bun was just ok. And the egg custard dessert pastry was too flaky that it fell apart and not authentic enough. The soup dumplings were definitely great and we were happy with those. During our meal we had finished our pot of tea and traditionally you just flip the top of the tea pot and the server knows you want a refill...but just to be sure I still asked one of the staff for more tea. But alas, all we got was the table cleared, the bill and no refill. With a bill that came to almost $200 before tip I really wanted to like this place...I really did...","Food - Truffle fried rice (recommended), Sticky rice with sausage (disappointing), Baked bbq pork bun (ok), Egg custard dessert pastry (too flaky, not authentic), Soup dumplings (great), Potato bread (good), Steam BBQ pork bun (good), Pecan Shrimp (good), Red Snapper (good)||Service - Not attentive||Ambiance - Nice||Price - high "
Qi Austin,"We made our reservation ahead of time. We got there a little early and they sat us immediately.

Qi Austin,"I have been wanting to visit Qi for some time and I was not disappointed! We shared the scallop sui mai and the chicken basil dumpling - both good. Not great. The dumpling had a crispy crunch that was delish. Then we had the baby bok choy and mushrooms which were an umami delight - silky and rich all at once. Then, the star.. the redfish. I hadn't expected a sweetish sauce, but the fish was perfectly cooked. This is a great dish to share with even 3 people. Had rice on the side, too. Then, since it was a birthday, they sent a candled hedgehog custard that was, perhaps, mango? Very tasty! All in all, our waiter was the most disappointing- seemed preoccupied snd uninterested in adding to our experience. There was a waiter from Guatemala who took care of us briefly and was amazing. I was also frustrated with the heaviness of the chopsticks. I'm fairly chopstick proficient, but these were difficult to use.","Food - Scallop Sui Mai (good), Chicken Basil Dumpling (good but crispy), Baby Bok Choy and Mushrooms (delightful), Redfish (perfectly cooked), Hedgehog Custard (tasty)||Service - Disappointing||Ambiance - Great||Food - Heavy chopsticks "
Qi Austin,"Terrific food and service.  We did dinner and will be back for Dim Sum.  The outdoor patio is directly on W 6th, so be prepared for the tourist transportation and sirens to interrupt your conversation.  Big city ambiance.  Inside is very nice and much quieter.  Dinner portions are large and appetizers and salads are great.  Next time we do dinner, we'll get appetizers and share an entrÃ©e.  Sharing is expected and extra plates are already on the table.

Qi Austin,"I had a great experience here at Qi! I made a reservation for Wednesday right when they opened and was seated as soon as we walked in since it was pretty much empty. The interior is a bit on the smaller side, but was super clean! I loved the ambiance and high ceilings as well.

I came with a friend and thought the akaushi beef stood out the most to us! It came in a sizzling clay dish and had the best sear. The chunks of meat was also very tender. The soup dumplings came in 5 pieces, and was super hot and fresh! I loved the texture of the dumpling skin, and the inside had a lot of soup. The zha jiang noodles were good, but in my opinion, not that special.

There was also lots of street parking available, and the service was amazing! I would definitely recommend Qi to try out their soup dumplings and for their ambiance, but I don't know if I would come regularly since i think it is slightly pricey for the food you get.","Food - Akaushi Beef (great), Soup Dumplings (hot and fresh), Zha Jiang Noodles (good, not special)||Ambiance - Interior is small, Clean, High ceilings||Parking - Lots of Street parking||Service - Amazing||Price - Slightly high "

Qi Austin,"Chinese American dinners can either be a treat or come off as a joke. Luckily, this place is actually worth your time. Make sure you eat inside. The atmosphere alone is worth coming in. They seem geared towards parties of 4 or bigger, so don't be surprised if they fill up quick on the weekends.

Lobster Dumplings - not worth it. Expensive, lackluster, and fairly large that will leave you fumbling with your chopsticks and mouth. I felt more resentful that I bought two orders than satisfied.

Beef pot stickers - I think these were ok, but depending on how much you can eat, you may want to reconsider

Calamari was WAY better than I thought it was gonna be. A delicate tender inside with a decent, sturdy breading on the outside. Just the right amount of seasoning as well.

The crab soup dumplings are a must out of all the dumplings. They pack a punch of seafood goodness in their broth

Pecan Shrimp is so damn satisfying. Panda Express vibes but elevated. Fresh shrimp, big hunks of pecan, and the right amount of sweet glaze.

Pork belly is a solid choice, but its not magical. I was expecting something that was going to be crispy or melt in your mouth, but that wasn't the case. Don't get me wrong - they were tender. But the fat wasn't rendered to a level of melt in your mouth goodness that I look forward to. The sauce they provide is the workhorse of the dish.

The peking duck is a fantastic choice, especially with the bao buns they serve. My only complaint is I wish the duck could have been more warm. I know it can hard to serve it fresh and hot, but that would have made the experience that much better. The hoison sauce aint no grocery store slop, so much sure you coat those buns with it.

The alligator gives me mixed feelings. I liked that still had some texture (not mushy soft but not rubbery chew), but if you didn't tell me it was alligator, I wouldn't have known. There wasn't that faint, swamp aftertaste that I actually look for afterwards.

The truffle egg fried rice, even though it doesn't seem like a obvious choice, was a highlight of the meal. The right amount of truffle that had me reaching for more.

The weakest point of this restaurant is their cocktails. They sound promising on paper, but the drinks come out as unimaginative twists of standards, more ice than liquor, and no sophistication in composition.  Depending on your taste and the size of the group, you may be better ordering wine honestly

The desserts are satisfying in that they offer some novelty, don't stick to cliches, yet still have the light footedness of asian desserts. Nothing sweet to the point that you cant get up from your chair, but enough to register the sugar along with all the other fruity floral flavors. Both desserts also had a fun element of playful textures and colors that enhance rather than make the situation hokey.","Food - Lobster Dumplings (expensive and lackluster), Beef Pot Stickers (ok), Calamari (delicate, tender interior), Crab Soup Dumplings (must-try), Pecan Shrimp (satisfying), Pork Belly (solid), Peking Duck (fantastic, but could be warmer), Alligator (mixed, likes texture, not too strong of an aftertaste), Truffle Egg Fried Rice (highlight), Coconut fried rice (good), Desserts (satisfying, novelty, light, fun elements of playful textures and colors)||Drinks - Weak||Ambiance - Geared towards parties of 4 or bigger||Service - Friendly and attentive "

Qi Austin,"If you are looking for chic Asian cuisine, look no further than Qi!  I only recently moved to Austin, and Qi is my perennial go to for dining.  I love the snow pea shoots, and anything tofu as my partner and I strive to be whole food plant based.  That being said, their soup dumplings are divine (I highly recommend the ones with crab), and pretty much anything you go with has been delicious.  Portions arent huge, so definitely order up and be prepared to share.  They also have a little 1/2 bottle of champagne, which was a nice value.  Some of the other ""chic"" Asian places in town aren't nearly as good but the sister restaurant is Lin's (common ownership) which I don't think is as good, and Wu Chow is also good but Qi remains my favorite.","Food - Snow Pea Shoots (recommended), Tofu (recommended), Soup Dumplings (divine, recommended), Portions small||Ambiance - Chic||Service - Friendly and attentive||Price - high "

Qi Austin,"Some of the best dim sum in Austin! Not only are the portions more than fair, the service is incredibly attentive and helped us pick off of a menu filled with great options. For dinner, the decor definitely stood out. From the polished wood furniture to the Asian chandeliers, the dining space is beautiful and definitely worth taking note of.

The Shanghai soup dumplings were fantastic; a delicate and thin skin with plenty of soup to go down with the savory pork filling. Sitting at the dim sum bar, we could watch the dim sum chefs work, and it's clear each dumpling is made with care. We also got the truffle fried rice, and even though we didn't indulge with the truffle, the dish itself had more than enough to offer. Each grain of rice was evenly coated in oil and packed with flavor, and nothing was overcooked in the dish. Finally, the green tea cremeso was amazing. Had it not been for the dim sum, this would have been the highlight of the meal! It's somewhere between a classic matcha cheesecake and a delicate fine dining sugar sculpture. Popping the bubble on top was as fun as you'd imagine, and it tastes incredible! Definitely will come back!","Food - Dim Sum (fantastic), Truffle Fried Rice (packed with flavor), Green Tea Creme So [/INST]"
Qi Austin,"OK, I first learned to cook seriously (50 years ago) from Chinese cookbooks, and Chinese dishes play a regular and important part in my own cooking. I've eaten in major Chinese-restaurant cities: San Francisco, New York, London. This is the best one I've ever been lucky enough to eat at. It is, hands down, easily the best restaurant of any kind in Austin.

It specializes in steamed dishes and dumplings (for me, the most difficult part of Chinese cooking), but everything is wonderful. Chef Ling Qi Wu's food is both delicious and unique. I've never found anything remotely like it, and I've never had a bad dish there. She makes the best hot and sour soup I've had, both in flavor and texture. I *wish* mine tasted that good. The steamed buns and pancakes feel like silk on the tongue and have a subtle trace of sweetness. If you choose the dim sum seating, the menu offers dishes in fanciful shapes. My last trip featured a dumpling that evoked a fat baby chick. The table next to ours had a ""crispy chicken turnover"" in the form of a cute little mouse. It counts as one measure of the aesthetic and dedication of the chef that she doesn't *have* to do this. As I say, the food on its own sets my taste buds dancing.

The decor, down to the chopsticks, is elegant, the staff friendly and extremely capable. You will pay more than what you expect at the usual place, but you get more value for the money (and a good typical Chinese restaurant already counts as a bargain).

The food isn't mere food, but art. I previously lived in New Orleans for 26 years, so I have some experience with great food. Dining becomes a memorable experience. After 17 years of living in Austin, we will be moving many states away. This is the only restaurant I'll miss. I would seriously consider visiting Austin just for this place, because like New Orleans, you can't get this food anywhere else. Qi's will remain one of the summits of my dining life.","Food - Dim Sum (excellent), Steam lobster dumplings (exceptional), Peking duck (one of the best he'd ever had), Sesame chicken (very good), Honey Akaushi Beef (one of the best he'd ever had)||Ambiance - Elegant||Service - Friendly and capable||Price - high "
Qi Austin,"Are you kidding me? This is undoubtedly the best Chinese restaurant in Austin. It may be one of the two best kitchens in the entire city. It's pricier than most other Chinese places but definitely worth the money.  I've eaten all three menus (lunch, dinner, dim sum brunch) -- some overlap, but enough variation to make each menu worth seeking out. The chef cooks at the highest level. Service is good and efficient.

The hot and sour soup is the most soul-satisfying I've had in my life (it's better than even mine). The dumplings and the steamed wrappers are all made in-house and they are, again, the best I've had in a lifetime of obsession with Chinese food. I like the steamed dishes (which I consider the hardest to do well)  best. Free parking conveniently located. They also, I believe, do curbside pickup. Yum.","Food - Hot and Sour Soup (soul-satisfying), Dumplings (best ever), Steamed Wraps (best ever), Free Parking||Service - Good and Efficient||Pricier than most Chinese places "
Qi Austin,"This restaurant is beyond impressive. We are originally from Taiwan living in Manhattan for the past decade, and are very pleased to have dishes that just tasted like from home. Multiple dishes tasted very similar to dishes from Din Tai Fong- if you know, it's the best world renowned Chinese restaurant originating in Taiwan that specializes in soup dumplings and noodles- and every dishes there including fried rice is just beyond delicious.

This restaurant pretty much took us back to Din Tai Fong in Taipei with its Soup dumplings and House Special Combination Fried Rice.

Scallop Caviar Sui Mai, Akaushi Beef Potsticker, Braised Ox Tail, Asian Fried Chicken with minced Garlic, Zha Jiang Noodle are all very tasty and flavorful - just like in Taiwan.

You could definitely pass on both the lobster and vegetable dumplings. The lobster was not worth the price point and the vegetable dumplings were not tasty.

All were delicious. Salt & Pepper Shrimp was the favorite. Lightly fried with perfect flavor and crisp. Shrimp flavor came through.

Soup dumplings were fresh and well flavored with great sauce with pickled ginger. Beef buns tasty and fresh only slightly sweet, noodles delicate and not over sauced. Partner said the soup was the best he's had and he's been around.

Qi Austin,"This place was extremely disappointing. What made it worse was the price of the dishes. $13 dollars for 5 pork soup dumplings meanwhile the $4.99 boxed soup dumplings at Trader Joe's is much better. The truffle fried rice tasted like fried rice with egg which was pretty bland. The Asian chicken was the best dish we ordered but the amount of chicken on the plate, it seemed like it was more like a Cornish hen. This place is definitely more on par with PF Chang's.

Qi Austin,"We were craving soup dumplings, so we went for lunch and checked them out. This place is very beautifully decorated. All the details were thought about.
We weren't greeted w a smile, but asked immediately if we had a reservation... we didn't. They had a steady stream of people, but weren't packed. All the tables outside were empty. We were sat quickly inside.
The service was not great. No one asked if we wanted drinks... the server came to take our order before even offering beverages. The entire time we were here we felt like we were imposing on them. Not pretentious, but more like we were not wanted? Hard to explain.
The second round of drinks we ordered never came, I had to ask for them a second time after about 25minutes.
The soup dumplings were really really good. But the entrees fell flat. We got a pine nut chicken and a Berkshire pork dish, that was just meh. Maybe we ordered wrong. It's hard to say as we had zero direction from staff.
I would try this place again, just bc maybe they were having an off day?","Food - Soup Dumplings (really good), Pine Nut Chicken (meh), Berkshire Pork (meh)||Ambiance - Beautifully decorated||Service - Lackluster, unfriendly, slow||Drinks - Ordered but never arrived "

Qi Austin,"I finally tried this place! We got the market fish. It's huge and enough for two people! The fish was tender and not spicy at all. I recommend their drink called electric daisy - it has a flower inside that numbs your tongue and makes it tingle for a minute. Service was great - the server cut our fish for us! We sat outside on the patio o a warm night with no issues. The inside is dark, intimate and decorated with lanterns and such. The bathroom is beautiful and has a bidet toilet but it seems like the bidet function is disabled.","Food - Market Fish (huge, tender), Electric Daisy (recommended)||Ambiance - Dark, intimate, decorated with lanterns||Service - Great, helpful with the fish "
Qi Austin,"Amazing experience at Qi a couple weeks ago.
I, as well as my large group, got seated immediately even though we didn't have an appointment, unfortunately.
The ambiance was beautiful, everything down to the dishes we used were gorgeous.
The service was great and our server walked us through the most popular dishes as well as answer questions we had about how many servings a dish had.
The food was DELICIOUS, so much so we had to order double of what we initially did.
Everything was priced fairly and even after ordering four entrees and about 5 appetizers, we only had to pay 16 each for a group of 8.
Highly highly recommend the Soup dumplings!!!

Qi Austin,"Went here for lunch on a Saturday. You must get a reservation, yes, even for lunch. Lots of fun foods to try. Service was a bit lagging considering how nice of a place it was, so don't go if you're in a hurry. There's a bidet in the bathroom, which was quite funny for a restaurant to have in Texas.

Qi Austin,"Food great. Service lacking.  Staff seemed inconvenienced at our 1pm reservation.  Lunch kitchen closes at 2, but we were declined a dessert order at 1:45.  

We literally had to flag down our waiter for service.  

And our check had several things on it that we did not order.  The server laughed and then brought us a corrected check.

Qi Austin,"If you like Lin you'll like Qi :) they are sister sites.   The spot has a slightly different vibe then Lin but it's more ""down town"" fancy vibes.  Loved the bar, it's small, but would be fun for a fancy happy date or something (post Covid). We had dim sum and it was yummy.  No disappointments.  The service was efficient and friendly.   We tried the crab soup dumplings they were def my favorite, I recommend.
Also, this is weird but go to the bathroom, they have those wild high tech toilets if that's your thing.
As far as covid distancing goes they did great.
We will be back! If you're a Lin fan and can't get a resy or just want to switch it up try here!

Qi Austin,Dim sum was on point but it took a very long time to get the 5 items we ordered which is the reason for the one star deduction.  One item would come out and then there would be a 15-20 minute wait before the next one. Soup dumplings were the best I have ever had. I would come back as the food is worth the wait as long as you are prepared and not super hungry like we were,"Food - Dim Sum (on point but slow service), Soup Dumplings (best ever)||Service - slow "
Qi Austin,"Gorgeous setting, great service and delicious food! We enjoyed the following:
- crab meat fish maw soup dumpling: my husband loved these, the dumpling dough was a bit too chewy for me
- lobster dumpling, steamed: delicious
- veggie dumpling, pan fried: our favorite of the 3 dumplings we tried, probably because the pan fry helped to take some of the chewiness from the dumping dough
- pea shoots: sautÃ©ed with garlic; nice to have but not a must have
- seafood curry: we LOVED this. Super flavorful, not too spicy, heathy amount of seafood, crispy veggies, would definitely recommend. Comes with a scallion pancake, which was also tasty. We added a side of steamed rice
- mango bomb: refreshing, delicate, delicious and unique way to end the meal

The ""gold digger"" was a pretty and tasty cocktail.","Food - Crab Meat Fish Maw Soup Dumplings (loved), Lobster Dumpling (delicious), Veggie Dumpling (favorite), Pea Shoots (sauted with garlic, nice to have), Seafood Curry (LOVED, not too spicy, healthy amount of seafood, Crispy veggies), Mango Bomb (refreshing, delicate, unique)||Drinks - Gold Digger (pretty and tasty)||Ambiance - Gorgeous setting||Service - Great "
Qi Austin,"We went in last night for dinner, and for a restaurant that is relatively still very new, they did an excellent job both with service and food. Kendall our server was great, made great menu recommendations and attentive. To start we had the Shanghai Soup Dumplings, Lobster Dumplings and Akaushi Beef Potstickers. We also had the Crab Meat Fish Maw Soup Dumplings, which for me these were real standout of the night - I could eat these daily, best dish. For the main my husband & I had the Combination Fried Rice and split the Peking Duck (half), which was sooo good - the crispy skin and flavors were delicious, and the rice was so savory, it was a perfect combination. They also make a fabulous Old Fashioned, and the ambiance is great.

Qi Austin,"I called the restaurant about 45 minutes before my friend had a reservation for a special birthday, and wanted to send a dessert to their table as a surprise. The guy who answered the phone was very dismissive and said they were already sending one over from the restaurant. I tried to ask if it could be from me and he abruptly hung up. Not great customer service.","Food - Dessert (dismissive, unaccommodating)||Service - Dismissive, unaccommodating "
Qi Austin,"Qi is an upscale Chinese cuisine restaurant. They have covered patio seating and a small/medium sized indoor seating. The menu is small and has a selection of dim sum even at dinner. All of the dumpling/bao were very tasty. The sea cucumber dumpling were black and never seen anything like it before. Flavor was very good with thick black sauce but could not recognize any sea cucumber in the filling. The truffle shaving photos I saw in some other reviews of the truffle fried rice showed loads of truffle shavings and raised our expectations. Ours only had 3, but tasted like truffle oil was added as well which added to the flavor which was good but we felt undertruffled for $18.  The salt n pepper tofu was good but not quite as crispy as we were hoping and the tofu pieces were very large. Too large such that the fried exterior to soft interior was too small. The imperial tofu also had large tofu pieces but they fit better with the sublime sauce. The Asian fried (roasted) chicken was good but lacking flavor so the dipping spices were necessary. I've had all these dishes in other cities and Qi's were good but not the best I've had and slightly under what I'd expect from a place vying for the top fine Chinese dining place in Austin so therefore only 4 star based on the prices and expectations they set for the customer.  All the dishes tasted as if many elements had been precooked and merely warmed prior to serving. Again, tasted good but has room to be better executed. Service was prompt and very professional, yes! but Kane D lacked the warmth or even a small smile which would've improved our experience since everyone is there for a fun night out not a serious, suit/tie formal experience. Another small annoyance that could easily be rectified is the sound of the mobile ordering app dining coming from the bar area every other minute with another to go order. This is very common at fast casual restaurants these days but Qi is capable and aspiring to be better.","Food - Dim Sum (very tasty), Sea Cucumber Dumplings (black and never seen anything like it, flavor was very good with thick black sauce but could not recognize any sea cucumber in the filling), Salt N Pepper Tofu (good but not quite as crispy as hoped, Tofu pieces were very large), Imperial Tofu (fit better with sublime sauce), Asian Fried Chicken (good but lacking flavor, could be precooked), Truffle Shaving (photos showed loads of truffle shavings and raised expectations but ours only had 3, tasted like truffle oil was added as well which added to the flavor which was good but we felt undertruffled for $18), Fried Rice (good but lacking something)||Service - Professional||Ambiance - Nice and cozy||Menu - Small||Price - high "

Qi Austin,"Visually, Qi lives to its expectations of a higher-end version of Lin-Asian.  The location may be intimidating due to all the construction around the building but parking is within the building, free, and within easy access of the restaurant.  

Service is good, friendly and very accommodating.   The menu has variety and should allow for diverse tastes to be able to have options.  For example, the pork loin was the equivalent of sweet and sour pork that can easily be found in Asian-American cuisine.  If you are into that type of dishes, I highly recommend it.   I was not, thus making it a bit disappointing.  In addition, the steamed rice was a bit dry, but the steamed halibut made up for it and for the meat bao that was just ok.  Definitely recommend the steamed halibut if you want something spicy and flavorful.  

The dessert presentations are very nice and a good end to the meal.","Food - Pork Loin (disappointing), Steamed Rice (dry), Steamed Halibut(recommended), Meat Bao (ok), Dessert Presentations (nice)||Location &amp; Parking||Service||Menu Variety "

Qi Austin,"I was suuuuuuuuper skeptical of this place as a Cantonese Chinese person based on the mostly white clientele and the (high) price point, but I was pleasantly surprised. It ranks among the best dim sum I've ever had, and this is coming from someone who is from NYC / Hong Kong and has lived in San Francisco. Most of the dim sum dishes are a bit of a spin on the classic - for example they do a fish maw soup dumpling rather than the classic pork or pork/crab one, and they have truffle fried rice. They also put more pieces than usual in each dish (6 pieces usually) but charge $10-11 per dish. They don't shy away from ingredients that might scare the average American either, serving stuff like alligator. It's also beautiful inside.","Food - Fish maw soup dumplings (pleasantly surprising), Truffle fried rice(good), Alligator (not bad)||Ambiance - Beautiful||Price - high "

The Shanghai soup dumplings were perfection.

The Salt and Pepper lobster was the best part of the meal.

The alligator was incredible in small bits otherwise it was a tad fatty or tough. The flavor was perfect - just perfect.

The truffle friend rice was simple yet complex - so glad we added this dish.

The drinks were great, we had Pinot, cab a d two mixed drinks. The gold digger was great but the Lychee Toni tasted like  Potpourri. Just not for me.

This place definitely have the worst Chinese food I have ever eaten.

The skin for the soup dumpling is extremely thick and chewy. The soups were flavorless. The Crab Meat soup tasted like egg drop soup. For entrees, we ordered the Asian fried chicken, Zha Jiang Noodle and fried rice. All of the food we ordered were extremely underwhelming in flavor and full of sodium.

The hostess and waiters were phenomenal and gave amazing recommendations for items on the menu. Everything is in family style portions, so order accordingly to feed 2-3 people per entree. The appetizers were amazing, and they even direct you how to properly eat a soup dumpling. The bao was OUT OF THIS WORLD. I would recommend anyone going to try it.

Qi Austin,"This is purely a review based on the take out portion for the rice. Most Chinese restaurants come with white rice with each entree, but I understand this is supposed to be a fancier style of restaurant, so things may be different.

Found this place off of Yelp and it is by far the best dim sum/Chinese food I've ever had and I lived in the SF Bay Area for three years! Who would have thought Tex-Ass was the place to go for dim sum!! The soup dumplings are to die for and the servers told us to poke a little hole on the top of them, then pour the sauce over them to cool them off and let the sauce soak into them, brilliant!

The roasted duck was superb! I'm quite petite and ate half a duck to myself, giving the boyfriend a small bite, yes, it was that good, haha.  I wanted to lick and swim into all the delicious sauces but the BF held me back, he's probably right. The BF ordered the alligator and it was ah-mazing! A cross between fish and chicken.

Qi Austin,"This place is right next to my company and I finally decided to check it out on Father's Day. As an Asian, I often heard that Chinese food is bad at high-end restaurants, and Qi Austin proved it wrong.

Setting:
- Very elegant and has very cute decors.

Food:
Food is served hot and fresh. The taste is amazing. The presentation is on-point. The portion is not small like other fancy restaurants, which I really do appreciate. Here are some of the dishes we ordered for dinner.
* [Appetizers] *
- Crab Meat Fish Maw Soup Dumpling: MUST GET. I love how chewy the skin is. I honestly won't forget how good the dumpling skin tastes.
- Scallop Caviar Sui Mai: this was good but just tastes like a fancy sui mai. Kinda hard to eat because the caviar just drops everywhere when you dip the food in soy sauce.
- Crispy Har Kaw with Sea Cucumber: MUST GET. At first, I was like why are these black. Though the har-kaw are fried, they don't taste oily at all. The sauce also has some hint of mayo and lime which is very light and refreshing.
* [Vegetable] *
- SautÃ©ed Mustard Green: the veggie is stir-fried with garlic-oyster-ish sauce and was so good. The veggie was still crunchy and wasn't feel drenched in the sauce.
* [Entree] *
- Peking Duck (half): MUST GET. It was interesting that they didn't serve the Peking Duck with the traditional wrap and duck skin but they gave us the steamed buns and onions and hoisin sauce so we can wrap things ourselves.The bun was amazing and the duck was roasted perfectly. The meat was super tinder and already sliced in bite size.  
- Mei Choy Pork Belly: MUST GET. So glad that our waiter suggested this dish for us. I love eating this with rice. The steamed pork belly was so tender and the preserved mustard balance and soy-based sauce balance out the fat. I can eat this forever.
- Braised Ox Tail: This was really good just to try out different dishes but I would not order this again. As a lazy person, I find it difficult to eat the whole big thing (the meat is just sticking to the bone too tightly). The sauce was really yummy tho.

Service:
- fast and efficient. We frequently got our plates changed for different dishes.  Our waiters were very kind too.

Tips:
- I recommend you come with a party of 3-4 and order many dishes to share with a table to have a full experience.
- Reserve a table beforehand on Resy to avoid waiting.","Food - Crab Meat Fish Maw Soup Dumpling (MUST GET), Scallop Caviar Sui Mai (good but drops excess caviar), Crispy Har Kaw with Sea Cucumber (MUST GET), Sauted Mustard Green (very good), Peking Duck (half), Mei Choy Pork Belly (MUST GET), Braised Ox Tail (really good but difficult to eat, excessive stickiness), Service - Fast and efficient||Ambiance - Elegant and cute decors "

Qi Austin,"Came for brunch with a girlfriend after a night of partying- and it was exactly what I needed for my hangover! We ordered too much food because we wanted to taste everything but it was worth it. My favorites were the shrimp cilantro dumplings, the lobster dumplings, beef baos, potato and shrimp balls, sautÃ©ed bok choy, Shanghai soup dumplings. Surprisingly the only thing we  thought was just okay was the pork and shrimp sui mai. But it was totally fine, we ate all of that too. There was still so much more on the menu that I wanted to try but couldn't because there was only two of us so I definitely cannot wait to go back.","Food - Shrimp Cilantro Dumplings (favorite), Lobster Dumplings (favorite), Beef Baos (favorite), Potato and Shrimp Balls (favorite), Sauted Bok Choy (favorite), Shanghai Soup Dumplings (favorite), Pork and Shrimp Sui Mai (okay)||Ambiance - Cozy and inviting||Service - Friendly and attentive "

I appreciate how kind and attentive all the staff are. I have also been there for dinner which is delicious as well. For dim sum you must try their Shanghai soup dumplings and for dessert the sesame balls are amazing. I tried the curry beef puffs recently and it was out of this world.

Qi Austin,"I was skeptical at fist because I've never went to a Dim Sum restaurant like this. I love the restaurant's theme and its decor. The crab meat soup dumplings were to die for, and I will definitely be ordering it again. The lobster dumplings were also great, but I prefer the crab ones instead. They make the lobster dumplings look like tiny bunnies which is very cute. All dumplings are paired with a sauce that brings an extra pop of flavor. The pecan shrimp were a 9/10  and goes well with white rice.

Qi Austin,"I was on yelp looking for Rice Noodle Rolls in Austin (still looking) and as I was reading reviews I thought I would check out Qi's reviews because I know it well. i travel a lot and when I get back to Austin it is normally my first stop. For those of you who know Dim Sum I will go on record that my measuring stick Is Din Tai Fun. I believe it is the only Michelin rated dim sum restaurant in the world. And No there is not one in Texas. They originate from Singapore and now have locations in Vegas and California. But back to why I am here....I first went to Lins; Qi's sister restaurant less than a mile away. It is equally good but more rustic dining area.
Sonny is the manager at Qi, if you dont know him him comes off a bit aloof maybe even a bit rude but I assure you he is a fantastic guy.
My orders are typically the Shanghai Soup dumplings, Har gas Shrimp, Beef Pot Stickers, Lobster dumplings. My wife loves the signature salad. Any of the salt and pepper dishes are great. I go here strictly for the Dim Sum and rarely have the entrees but have had several and I have no complaints but I tend to over order the dim sum that is FANTASTIC.
i was reading somebody hated the House Special Combination Fried rice in their review and that is what drove me to write a review. One night while with a group we were served somebody else's Fried Rice and since we were all sharing we had already started eating it before we realized it wast ours. Best mistake ever, I now order it if I am extra hungry because it is fantastic.
Parking Tip: Free garage parking above the restaurant in ramps garage, elevator opens directly in lobby where restaurant entrance is.
If you have doubts about the authenticity of this place sit at the back bar. It is a glass window into the kitchen so you can watch them make the dumplings.

Warm lighting throughout shine through the parasol fixtures on the ceiling. And the impressed feeling doesn't end there -- our dishes were outstanding as well. We ordered the lobster dim sum and soup dumplings, and you could taste the umami and time, dedication, and love put into them with each bite. Our main dish was the curry seafood - again, full of flavor and cooked to perfection. We went all the way in with dessert and got the mango bomb and chocolate.

Qi Austin,One of the best dining experiences in Austin that I've had so far. Every dish was unique and flavorful. I forgot to review so my memory on the specific dishes is a bit fuzzy. Salt and Pepper Lobster was too awesome to forget - well seasoned and a must have. This was also the first time I had soup dumplings so I didn't know what to expect but they were bursting with flavor when you bite in.  Since then I've had others but these were significantly better.

Qi Austin,"If you haven't been to Lima yet, go there. I love Lims and while Qi is also very good, the overall atmosphere is just better at Lims. I also think there is a broader variety of options at Lims. (Lims is owned by the same group) I felt the best dishes we had were ones you can also get at Lims.

Qi Austin,"great decor and ambience and service. super clean bathrooms.

the entres were super greasy, the batter on the shrimp was too thick and flavorless, and the rice was dry. their website talks about ""Heathy diet"" and I was expecting the food to be cleaner and more elevated especially for the price but unfortunately, it was not which is a shame because otherwise it could have been somewhere I'd want to frequent more.","Food - Entrees (super greasy), Batter on Shrimp (thick and flavorless), Rice (dry)||Ambiance - Great||Service - Super clean||Price - high "
Qi Austin,"Really delicious and creative food and drink! My personal favorite were the crab meat and fish maw soup dumplings, the soup inside the dumplings really added nice flavor!! We also enjoyed the halibut which was steamed perfectly as well as the birds nest with seasonal veggies. The birds nest is made of fried taro which tasted so good when soaked in the sauce for the veggies. I also loved the szechuan peppercorn alligator, which tastes like a slightly gamier chicken but with chewier and juicier texture.

Qi Austin,"Wow! What a struggle for me. Couldn't decide between 4 or a 5 but ultimately I decided on a 5.
Why I thought it was a 4 - soup dumpling was stuck to the paper and wouldn't come off without ripping, which led to the soup leaking. However...
We sat at the bar. And the bar service was amazing. The bartender was nice, quick to respond. Don't know about the table service but bar service was top notch.
The food was freaking amazing. I had the lobster dumpling, pork and shrimp sui mai, cilantro shrimp dumpling, steam bbq pork bun, and the zha jiang noodles in addition to the soup dumpling and all were fantastic! Its a bit hot so gotta watch before eating not to burn the roof of your mouth but amazing. And promptly came out one after another so there was no break between each dish.
It's a bit busy and I was here Sunday 1:20 so might need a reservation before but I'd definitely recommend this place.

Qi Austin,"The service was exceptional and the overall atmosphere was lovely - especially during the holiday season. The cocktails were fun but a bit overpriced - didn't pack the flavor punch I was hoping for. The alligator was very dry but flavorful - wouldn't recommend getting a side of steamed rice with it. The sesame chicken was very good, had lots of sauce, and paired nicely with the steamed rice. Didn't get a chance to take a photo of the lobster dumplings for our appetizer but there were 3 in one order and were DELICIOUS.

Qi Austin,"Oh we really enjoyed this restaurant! I was craving dim sum and this hit the spot! We had several different little options for our dinner and each one was outstanding! We only have one restaurant in our home town that offers dim sum, so we make sure to go whenever we travel. Qi Austin did not disappoint. We had both kinds of soup dumplings, the har gow, pot stickers (beautiful presentation!), and the beef bao. They were all phenomenal. The staff were friendly and helpful, the restaurant was clean and beautifully decorated, and parking is in a covered lot attached to the building.

Qi Austin,"Really enjoyed the food here. I recommend to anyone who enjoys Asian cuisine. Get an appetizer, entree, and cocktail! Giving 4 star because I personally wanted more vegetable offerings alongside the entree inside of a side dish. However you must know that the dishes are served family style - didn't really work for my party considering our dietary restrictions.  Hence the comment above.

Qi Austin,"The new Qi restaurant is the sister restaurant of Lin's.
First I must say they did an amazing job on the decor from top to bottom! It's beautiful.
It's very spacious, with a large outside patio and a private room upstairs for a large group!
On the food! I was a little disappointed that it's not much of a difference from Lin's. BUT that's definitely not a bad thing because Lin's is amazing!
The soup dumplings are the best I've had in the US! Lin the owner/chef knows how to make those dumplings!
Also on the other food I highly recommend the whole fried snapper! It was cooked to perfection! Also loved the braised Oxtail. They have a huge selection of wines and nice cocktails! The desserts are delicious and beautifully made!

We tried the soup dumplings and potstickers for appetizers and overall everything was good, not the best we have ever had, but solid. For our main course we had the honey beef, and that dish was excellent, we would come back for that alone. In addition, we had the mixed combination rice, most of which we took with us, but I ate it the next day and it was still great.

It bothered the tables next to us which was understandable and we would've loved to help resolve it with moving or turning it off.

Qi Austin,"If I could give Qi more than 5 stars, I would! Qi is a must see; as soon as we walked in we were greeted by the restaurant owner who was serving as the host. The reservations are a must for this restaurant; during our time there, we saw many people turned away because they didn't have a reservation.
So let's get started on a review of the food. The pork dumplings are a must try, the lobster dumplings were good but not as good. The rice was light and fluffy but full of flavor and the chicken was crunchy and saucy. I got the lavender gin drink and it was beautiful and tasty.
Now to talk about the service; we were in and out of Qi faster than I would have imagined because the service was quick and the food amazingly fast. This restaurant is smaller which is why reservations are necessary, but once you're in, you'll experience that 5 star service that is so hard to come by now a days.
Whenever I visit Austin again, Qi will be on the must stop list and whenever I have to give a recommendation of where to eat in Austin, I'll say Qi.","Food - Pork Dumplings (must try), Lobster Dumplings (good but not as good), Rice (light and fluffy, full of flavor), Chicken (crunchy and saucy)||Drinks - Lavender Gin (beautiful and tasty)||Service - Quick, amazingly fast||Location - Small, necessary for reservations||Ambiance - Nice "

SO SO GOOD! We had to order a second serving because of how good these dumplings are. Next we ordered the Peking Duck as recommended by our wonderful waitress. Holy cow this dish is tasty. The duck is so flavorful and the mini buns that come with it are sweet and savory all at the same time. Last, we ordered the Zha Jiang Noodle. Once again blown away by how tasty the dish was. This was the best experience I've had at a restaurant in a very long time. I usually don't write reviews, but Qi is definitely deserving! If you're questioning going to Qi, stop and just go.

Qi Austin,Review is for takeout. Over priced and gave small amount of rice for 3 entrees that were also not filled well. For paying $25-$30 an entree that's pretty lame. Food was just okay on top of that but I am used to great Asian food coming from Houston :-),"Food B-E-R-E-A-K-I-N-G news flash!

Qi Austin,"To start I had the lychee tini, it was refreshing and I'll definitely order it again if I come back. For appetizers I tried the soup dumpling and it was delicious! Much better than Lin Dim Sum even though they're owned by the same people. They gave little bowls for the soup dumplings too which makes it way easier to eat. My entrees included the akauski beef with green bell pepper and the imperial tofu. The beef was too fatty although it had a good taste. The imperial tofu was great but I did have minor food poisoning after eating something here. We also found a gnat in the rice. Our server was extremely friendly and the tables were spaced out nicely.

When we entered the restaurant it  took the staff a while to greet us and check us in  which was fine, we understand  they  may have been a little understaffed. When we finally got seated our server was so rude and short  with us from the  beginning. He rushed us into ordering and gave us an attitude when we asked questions about the  menu or took a minute to give him our order. Up to that point we figured he was just having a bad day but things escalated when I asked him a question about one of the dishes and he totally snapped.

Qi Austin,"I recently sat down for dinner there.  I had reviewed the menu in advance as I have an allergy to mushrooms.  Nothing on the menu revealed an issue.  

Unfortunately when I arrived and mentioned my allergy to my waiter, he at first didn't think that it would be an issue.  However, having experienced an issue with mushrooms being undisclosed on all food at Wu Chow, I asked the waiter to check.   He subsequently came back and told me that mushrooms were basically on all dishes and that dishes could not be prepared without them.

Needless to say, my party and I could not stay and left for dinner elsewhere.  

My concern however, is that had I not asked the waiter to actually check with the food preparers, I would have experienced an allergic reaction and likely, a night in the hospital.

The menu looked very enticing but, without the ability to avoid mushrooms, I can not go back.",Food - Mushroom-based||Service - Waiter did not check with kitchen before assuring customer that mushrooms would not be an issue

Qi Austin,"Had dinner at Qi the other night and food was delicious! We started with the recommended Shanghai soup dumplings (5 pieces) and beef Bao (3 baos) and both were very tasty. We then split the truffle egg fried rice and spicy chicken with pine nuts (pictured) which were great as well! Those 4 items definitely filled up my husband and I. Ambience is good, decor very beautiful, and they are doing an okay job at spacing out guests. We specially reserved a table outdoors hoping to be spaced out more, however back to back tables were almost touching so not the most social distanced for our liking.

Qi Austin,"It just okay, unfortunately. We really love Lin so a bit disappointed. We got the honey beef for our entree, and it was SOOOO SWEET. I literally was fighting to finish one bite. The seafood dumplings were actually really good, and we got scallop ""caviar"" su Mai. We were fully expecting caviar (cause it's stated on the menu, and mentioned by server) but it's salmon roe, so eh not *technically* caviar. So this was our first dish and it kinda set precedent for the rest of the being. Our cocktails were tasty, but nothing memorable. Maybe we'll give it another shot and just get dumplings/apps how we do at Lin. Service was good, manager is funny. Very pretty space, but hopefully these inconsistencies get squared away with time.","Food - Honey Beef (Too Sweet), Seafood Dumplings(Good),Scallop Caviar Sui Mai (Good)||Ambiance - Pretty Space||Service - Good||Drinks - Tasty Cocktails||Menu - Inconsistent "

Qi Austin,"Qi offers a higher end version of Chinese that is extremely approachable for an American.  Has a New York hotel restaurant feel with tons of wines ready to pour, bunch of choice cocktails and a few beers on draft (including Pinthouse for $10).  Portions aren't bad and you'll leave full with a few dim sum, appetizers, and entrees.

As far as food, this is where my review falls off a bit.  The big theme of my items was ""flavorless.""  Had the beef bao, truffle fried rice, salt and pepper tofu, and chicken with pine nuts.  All dishes had a more healthy taste than authentic Chinese, as if there was less salt or msg.  The fried rice was very soft and the tofu was virtually just a big cube of tofu.  Chicken was white meat and actually my favorite dish of the night, and this wasn't even a dish I had heard of before in Chinese cuisine.  Most dishes also came on a weird, wet lettuce that might look good but was trying a bit hard.  Cocktails were solid and the numbing flower drink is always a fun order.

Service was good and they do a great job of letting you know house favorites.  Nice place to try a bunch of dim sum, day or night, but still feel like you're having an upscale dining experience.  Nice addition to Austin, but don't expect Qi to replace any of your North Austin Chinese favorites.","Food - Beef Bao (tasteless), Truffle Fried Rice (tasteless), Salt and Pepper Tofu (tasteless), Chicken with Pine Nuts (tasteless)||Drinks - Numbing Flower Drink (fun)||Service - Good||Ambiance - New York hotel restaurant feel||Menu - Huge "

Qi Austin,"Dined in on New Years Day. We originally tried to go to Lin's but they didn't have any reservations available. To our surprise, we didn't even know it was a sister restaurant until we sat down! They only had availability outside which was fine because they had heaters. We ordered both types of soup dumplings (fish and classic) which were delicious! We also had the seafood chow fun which was very different than your typical seafood chow fun, but piled high with a variety of seafood. The noodles were cooked to perfection! In addition, my husband and I enjoyed a Vietnamese style vegetable that tasted like wilted lettuce, but was seasoned well. Lastly, we had the most eye catching dessert I've ever had! A chocolate mousse type with a clear gelatin surrounded by a literal ice igloo! (See photos) it looked stunning! And even tasted great!

Qi Austin,"Dim Sum Brunch yesterday was lovely!
We Used Resy to book outdoor patio space in advance. Four adults, two children, one dog. We all fit just perfectly in a large front patio table and felt safe with social distancing between other tables. The staff wore masks & gloves at all times.
Soup & Lobster Dumplings were by far our faves. Pork & Shrimp Sui Mai was the runner up. Not a single dish we didn't like. Nice selection of unique & classic cocktails.
Our party all felt Qi dim sum was better vs Wu Chow.  Beautiful decor inside & the fancy bidets in restrooms are a nice touch :)  Overall they offer a high end dining option without being pretentious.
My only 2 callouts
1. Not much selection of basic ""kid friendly"" items for like tofu or rice dishes brunch. So older kids should do just fine, but this may not be your best bet if you need to bring smaller kids.
2. The staff was very attentive & professional, but conversation was limited and answers to menu questions very short. Again nothing negative here, just don't be offended by the lack of jolly banter from your server - they are focused on bringing out multiple hot dishes of fabulous food :)","Food - Soup & Lobster Dumplings (favorite), Pork & Shrimp Sui Mai (favorite), Crab Meat Corn Soup (very good), Fried Snapper with Sweet & Sour sauce (very good), Combination Fried Rice (very good), Sesame Chicken (very good), Orange Chicken (very good)||Service - Professional, attentive||Ambiance - Beautiful, Fancy bathrooms||Menu - Huge "

Qi Austin,"Very underwhelmed by the flavor and seasoning of the food. We had the combination fried rice ($20) and it was the worst fried rice I have ever had in my life. Some of the rice was still hard and not fully cooked when fried rice should be cooked twice on the principles of cooking fried rice. We also had the pork belly dish ($20+) and it was also very underwhelming. Pretty much pork belly covered in cheap soy sauce with too much vinegar.

This place masks itself under mid to high price dining cost to make you think it is good food, yet their patrons must be of the unseasoned loving kind. For real though stay away, their food is trash, for you  can get way better food at a better price. I will pay great money for great food and this is not even good food.
