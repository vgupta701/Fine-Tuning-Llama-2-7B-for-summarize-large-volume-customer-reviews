    "#<</SYS>> Had dinner at Qi the other night and food was delicious! We started with the recommended Shanghai soup dumplings (5 pieces) and beef Bao (3 baos) and both were very tasty. We then split the truffle egg fried rice and spicy chicken with pine nuts (pictured) which were great as well! Those 4 items definitely filled up my husband and I. Ambience is good, decor very beautiful, and they are doing an okay job at spacing out guests. We specially reserved a table outdoors hoping to be spaced out more, however back to back tables were almost touching so not the most social distanced for our liking. All staff is wearing masks, some wearing gloves. No temperature checks.[/INST]\"\"\",\n",

I want you to produce an output that would contain the key topics discussed by the customer in the review and a brief takeaway for each topic. Topics should be within - Food, Drinks, Ambiance, Price, Service, Parking, Menu, Location and Music. Please include one topic for sure called Food for which the takeaway would simply be all the food items mentioned by the customer and a short assessment of customer’s view about that food in brackets not going beyond 5 words in length. If no food item is mentioned and the word food is missing, skip that topic. If no food item is mentioned but the word food is mentioned, summarize customer’s opinion of the food in general. Please separate any two topics by || and any two takeaways by a comma. Please stick to this format and do not output any extra text. Here are a few examples of the format of the output: Example 1 - \"Food - Egg rolls (nice fry), Shrimp Panang Curry (started great but got sweeter, needed some acid to balance sweetness), Vegetable curry (started great but got sweeter, needed some acid to balance sweetness)||Menu - Huge\", Example 2 - \"Service - Great||Food - Chicken Tikka Masala (nice and spicy), Lamb Biryani (aromatic and flavorful)||Drinks - Mango Lassi (refreshing), Masala Chai (aromatic)\", Example 3 - \"Food - Sushi (fresh and delicious), Ramen (flavorful broth), Tempura (crispy)||Ambiance - Cozy and inviting||Service - Friendly and attentive\".\"\"\"\n",
