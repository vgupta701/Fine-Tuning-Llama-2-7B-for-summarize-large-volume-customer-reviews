Christian was fabulous. We would highly recommend! Made our honeymoon experience. Everything on the menu is elevated but reasonably priced. The ambiance is everything. Can't wait to come back,Ambiance - Great||Menu - Elevated||Price - Reasonable||Service - fabulous
"As soon as we walked in it was very very warm but I figured because we were super close to the door when we walked in that's why... just wait.

We got the soup dumplings which were 4/5 because they were super super delicate but very flavorful.

Also got the duck skewers which were my favorite part of the night. 5/5

At this point I started sweating a little bit but figured I would cool down...

Entrees came and I got the lamb chops which were served in a bowl which made it hard to eat and the chops were on the chewy side so it was a 3/5.

My boyfriend got the sesame chicken which was very tasty 5/5.

By the time we started eating I wanted to leave so bad because no A/C was running. My boyfriend & I were excited to get dessert but by this time we wanted to leave because we felt sweaty & gross... also, the warm water didn't help at all...

This place was good but needs some improvement on the small things. I'm being picky because I've worked in restaurants & I have a degree in hospitality administration so there was lots of little things that could've made my experience better.","Food - Soup dumplings (delicate and flavorful), Duck skewers (favorite), Lamb Chops (hard to eat in a bowl and chewy), Sesame chicken (tasty)||Ambiance - Very warm"
Visited from Hawaii and was looking for a place with good food and music. 1618 did NOT disappoint. Food and service was amazing! As well as the live performance. Jackie was our server for the night and did such an amazing job! She was very attentive with such a positive attitude. The GM Jonel was very kind and always made sure we were enjoying our evening. I would definitely recommend this place to others!,"Food - Amazing||Music - Live performance||Service - amazing, attentive with a positive attitude"
"1618 Asian fusion had great service! Shout out to Graham, Anj, Kiara and Bryan were so attentive. Super sweet, fast, and provided the best service at the bar top!

The Bao buns were delicious and General TSO chicken was fresh and full of flavor

The ambiance was super casual but lovely relaxing atmosphere, amidst the heavy traffic.","Food - Bao buns (delicious), General Tso chicken (fresh and flavorful)||Ambiance - casual but lovely relaxing atmosphere||Service - great, best service at the bar top, super sweet and fast"
"Huge menu.  Egg rolls for appetizer and Shrimp Panang Curry for main dish.

The egg rolls had a nice fry.  The combination of shrimp and pork worked well.

The shrimp curry started out great.  It was creamy with the right amount of spice.  It was a big dish and it got sweeter the more we ate.  The curry needed some acid or salt to balance the sweetness.  Exact same feedback for the vegetable curry.

In all a very good meal.","Food - Egg rolls (nice fry), Shrimp Panang Curry (started great but got sweeter, needed some acid to balance sweetness), Vegetable curry (started great but got sweeter, needed some acid to balance sweetness)||Menu - Huge"
"Came with friends for dinner on a Friday night. We had reservations for a table of 4. We were seated right away.

Our server greeted us promptly and had our drinks placed immediately. I tried the dragon fruit refresher and it was absolutely delicious!!

We split the appetizer for the table. I enjoyed the pork bun and the satays. The fresh spring roll, I would recommend, eating first because the wrap ends up sticking to the banana leaves and tears the longer you let them sit. I wish it was served with a peanut butter sauce, but it wasn't a deal breaker.

I ordered the green curry with filet mignon. Comes with steamed rice. The dish is so rich, but all I could taste was the smokiness of the steak. It overpowered the sweet curry. I liked that it had plenty of veggies and the steak was cut in bite sized pieces. It is on the spicier side, fair warning. You also can't adjust the spice level.

I tried my friend's crispy pad Thai, which was absolutely delicious. The sauce is rich and you can really get the lime flavor. It is pretty spicy though. I don't know if I'd be able to eat the whole dish, but it's yummy.

To get the spice out of my mouth, I ordered the Ube pana cotta. Oh my goodness!! This is such a stellar dessert!!! Ube was perfect. Not too sweet and the panna cotta was divine!!! I would go again just for this dessert.","Food - Dragon fruit refresher (absolutely delicious), Pork bun (enjoyed), Satays (enjoyed), Fresh spring roll (recommended but sticks to banana leaves if not eaten first), Green curry with filet mignon (rich with overpowering smokiness of the steak, on the spicier side), Crispy pad Thai (absolutely delicious but pretty spicy), Ube panna cotta (stellar dessert, perfect ube flavor, divine)||Service - Friendly and sweet"
"I've been here so many times I feel like I've tried everything on the menu at this point.
For the new things: we tried the beef skewers and although they were tasty they had a very strong, specific flavor to them with the fish sauce and Thai basil wrapping (I think?). Not necessarily something I'd order again. Along with that, we got the crispy pad Thai which id never had before - the crispy noodles were not my thing but the flavor of this dish was fantastic honestly. Trying to figure out how we get these flavors on their regular pad Thai!
Our go tos:
1. Soup Dumplings
2. Duck skewers
3. Salt & pepper calamari
4. Coconut fried rice
5. Pineapple fried rice
6. Shrimp panang curry
7. Filet mignon with onion

Make a ressie - you'll need it...but either way, go here. Fantastic food. Always great service. Plenty of parking and nice ambiance.","Food - Beef Skewers (tasty but very strong flavor), Crispy Pad Thai (crispy noodles not good but flavor was fantastic), Soup Dumplings (good), Duck skewers (good), Salt & pepper calamari (good), Coconut fried rice (good), Pineapple fried rice (good), Shrimp panang curry (good), Filet mignon with onion (good)||Service - great||Parking - plenty||Ambiance - nice"
"DEEE-LI-CIOUS!
Once you get past the slightly odd location in an apartment complex, the actual ambiance of the place is great. There's parking garages to park in for free so no issues there.
We started with the salt and pepper calamari along with the duck skewers. I'm not a huge fan of duck but with so many reviews on this dish, I had to give it a try and it was honestly delicious. Wasn't ""duck"" tasting at all! The calamari was also good and exactly what you would expect but I would have preferred a bigger portion for the price.
We then ordered the chicken pad Thai, seafood fried rice served in a coconut and the red curry with chicken. All 3 entrees were absolutely delicious with the perfect amount of heat for me without asking for any adjustments.
I would order the exact same meal again if I had to but ofcourse next time I'll want to try some of their other dishes as I'm sure they'll be as good!
Lastly, service was excellent. Our server was informative and very welcoming - cherry on top!","Food - Salt and pepper calamari (good but small portion), Duck skewers (delicious), Chicken pad Thai (absolutely delicious with perfect heat), Seafood fried rice served in a coconut (absolutely delicious with perfect heat), Red curry with chicken (absolutely delicious with perfect heat)||Location - odd||Ambiance - Great||Parking - free||Service - Informative and welcoming"

"I recently dined at 1618 Asian Fusion in Austin, and I must say, it was an exceptional experience. From the moment I walked in, I was captivated by the inviting ambiance. The restaurant's decor exuded a warm and modern charm that set the perfect tone for a delightful evening.

Now, let's talk about the star of the show - the food. The menu at 1618 Asian Fusion offers a diverse range of Asian cuisines, and every dish we ordered was an absolute delight. The flavors were a symphony of tastes that left our taste buds dancing with joy. The presentation of each dish was impeccable, demonstrating the kitchen's commitment to both taste and aesthetics.
Show shopper dishes and must try - Banana Leaf salmon, Flambeau Cheescake, tempura Tofu

But what truly elevated our dining experience was our server, Ana. She was not only attentive and knowledgeable about the menu but also displayed a genuine passion for ensuring our meal was a memorable one. Her recommendations were spot-on, and she went above and beyond to cater to our needs. Ana's friendly and warm demeanor added a personal touch that made us feel like valued guests.

In summary, 1618 Asian Fusion in Austin is a gem for food enthusiasts looking for an outstanding culinary adventure in a tastefully designed setting. The combination of delectable cuisine, a cozy ambiance, and the exceptional service provided by Ana make it a must-visit destination for anyone seeking a memorable dining experience.

"The wait was really long, so we put our name down and left, but about 30 minutes later we were able to be seated at the bar.

They had some really cool looking drinks what fruit around the display case, if you want something alcoholic to try. There was so much on the menu I wanted to get, but we agreed on the pho with short ribs and filet and the stir fried filet dish.

I like how they pour the broth at your table. The meats for both dishes were flavorful and tender. The soup broth was delicious as well. It was fun interacting with the bartender too. She was so friendly and sweet.","Food - Pho with short ribs and filet (flavorful broth, tender meats), Stir fried filet dish (flavorful and tender meats)||Drinks - Cool looking||Service - Friendly and sweet"
"1618 is a nice restaurant for an occasion, but overrated in my books. Definitely make a reservation before you go.

The food is tasty and the service is really solid, but the price for the portion is not so good. I was excited about the shrimp but you only get 5 pieces. Perhaps the best thing to get is the crispy pad thai, because it's something novel where the noodles are fried. Other things I tried could be found elsewhere in larger quantities at a less fancy place. Nonetheless, it's quality stuff and their cheesecake makes you feel classy.

There's free parking in the garage in the back.

I'll be back for another birthday dinner!","Food - Crispy pad thai (novel concept with fried noodles, tasty), Shrimp (tasty but small portion)||Service - solid||Price - high||Parking - free"
"I love the Peking duck here! Probably my fav Peking duck in Austin. It'd be great if there was an option to sub buns for crepes though :) the coconut fried rice was okay, not my favorite. It had some Tom-yum flavor, which I usually like for soup but tasted a bit strange for rice. 10/10 for presentation of the fried rice though. Good service, very friendly servers. Nice ambiance. I would definitely come back!","Food - Peking duck (favorite, prefer option to sub buns for crepes), Coconut fried rice (okay, Tom-yum flavor tasted strange for rice, perfect presentation)||Service - friendly||Ambiance - nice"
"My goodness. I'm a fan. The ambiance is upbeat and a bit loud at times, but it's wonderful for a dinner date. The xiao long bao is a MUST! The five sampler is a good portion to split with someone and it's nice to try a bit of everything!

The Pad Thai is good, but the next time I come I have to explore some newer options here. I wish I saved some room for dessert because that also looked incredible at the neighboring tables.

Big fan and will go again! Be wary of a bit of a wait time during peak dinner hours!

Cheers!","Ambiance - Upbeat, bit loud, wonderful for dinner date||Food - Xiao long bao (MUST try), Five sampler (good portion to split), Pad Thai (good)"

"Visited 1618 for dinner during my visit after seeing it on Yelp's Top 100 list! We made a reservation a few weeks out. It's beautiful inside, and our server was extremely friendly and helpful.

My one gripe is that they don't offer any modifications to the majority of their dishes - I totally understand from a chef perspective, but as someone with dietary restrictions (and a low spice tolerance!!) it made it difficult because we couldn't order a few of the things we initially wanted to and had to pivot.

We split the house fried rice. It was delicious, but we were really hoping to try the more exciting pineapple or coconut ones - neither of which could have the spiciness removed so we opted out. I liked that we could get a combo of chicken, shrimp, and beef. We both agreed that the beef was our favorite.

I got the duck skewers, which were AMAZING. I just wish they were bigger!!! The dipping sauce they came with was perfect too. So tender and flavorful.

My friend ordered steamed dumplings. They were rainbow colored, and I'm not sure how they make them colorful so it kind of freaked me out a bit since I try not to consume artificial coloring, etc. I did try one and felt it was too chewy for my liking - I probably would have preferred them fried.","Food - House fried rice (delicious), Duck skewers (AMAZING, small portion), Steamed dumplings (colorful, too chewy)||Service - friendly, helpful||Ambiance - Beautiful"
"I completely understand why this place was on the top 100 restaurants in the country list. It's awesome.

Ambiance: Tucked away on Riverside, large wooden doors lead to a beautifully lit dining room, intimate bar and stunning decor. Each table is decorated with greenery.

Service: The staff is pretty attentive, no complaints. They take time to explain the menu and give suggestions. I've only had subpar service once.

The goods: I've had everything from the curries to fried rice, summer rolls, salt and pepper prawns and pad Thai. Everything was delicious, though the curries tend to be on the sweeter side.

I can't wait to dine here again.","Food - Delicious, curries tend to be on sweeter side||Ambiance - beautifully lit, intimate bar, stunning decor||Service - attentive, helpful"
"We were very impressed! They were able to seat us without a reservation. Everything was delicious! I loved the long bao and egg bao! Orange chicken was great too.

"It pains me to write this review but I have waited long enough to do so. We used to love coming here, definitely one of our favorites and recommended it to so many. The special memories we have made here will last forever. However, now when I pass the restaurant I get a little queasy, a little sad, and not mad... but definitely dissappointed.

The last time we visited here, we brought a guest with us and we had a fantastic meal. However, all three of us became very ill within the next 24 hours. 100% food poisoning. It hit me the worst, because I was pregnant on top of it and ended up in the emergency room all night. Thankfully our guest didn't have it hit her until her plane landed back in her home state. I felt awful for taking her somewhere that ended up making us all sick, although I know anything can happen anywhere and it isn't necessarily a reflection of the establishment. We have never had an issue there any other time.

The problem was their reaction to this when we called them to let them know that others might be I'll as well and we wanted to give them a run down of what we ate so they could figure out what it was. The original person we spoke with was more than apologetic and ready to help but whoever he gave the information to, was not. They quite literally tried to blame us and say it was probably food allergies. Yes, all three of us suddenly have a good allergy we never knew about and all of us have the same one with the same reaction and it only hit us after eating at your restaurant. We had to stay extremely persistent to get any kind of help in the situation.

I miss their great food and violin events, but haven't been able to get myself to go back after their reaction to such a disappointing experience.",Food - Food poisoning
"We have been passing by this time and time again and wanting to go, yet just never made the move! Well my husband finally took me for a nice dinner and my oh my were our mouths and bellies thankful for the experience! And ""experience"" is the only way to describe this! Our first visit, our server was amazing and so helpful with recommendations- she actually convinced me to order something completely different just by her passion for this specific dish. We started the with soup dumplings and actually had no idea how to eat them - but you can find anything on YouTube these days right? I'm being 1000% serious, I totally searched in on YouTube so we could properly eat these dumplings. When I say I could quite literally just order multiple orders of the dumplings and eat them as my appetizer, meal, and dessert.... I mean it. The calamari was  seasoned to perfection and so satisfying. I'm fairly certain I got a box for two pieces of calamari. That's just silly to you if you haven't had it before... but once you have it, you, too, will not let it go to waste. The dipping sauce was the perfect match. For dinner, I got the Filet Green Curry and WOW , this was just the right dish for me, not too spicy, enough to save for second meal the next day (which was gold) - and very flavorful! My husband was the winner here, he got the Pho Rib (served with a filet) and DAMMMMNNNNN GINA! The presentation, the taste, the impending doom we both felt as the dish came near its end- because that flavor deserves to be tasted forever.  This dish was the star for sure!

We went back again on Christmas Eve for an incredible evening with Omar Phoenix playing the violin and we sat and ate and drank and melted in the presence of this incredible artist for four hours. I could write about that night alone forever but then I might need a publisher and a pen name. Magical. This place is absolutely magical.

Pro tips: the old fashioned is $18 but it's prepared tableside in a smoker and it's a whole thing! We enjoyed them. The five sampler: totally worth it. Eat the soup dumplings and watch youtube to do it properly. Your server can be amazing or mediocre but the food will always satisfy. If Omar is playing, make reservations, bring your friends, and go! Someone at your table MUST order the Pho Rib. That is a non negotiable.","Food - Soup dumplings (recommended), Calamari (seasoned to perfection, satisfying), Filet Green Curry (flavorful), Pho Rib (star of the meal)||Drinks - Old fashioned (worth it)||Service - Amazing, helpful with recommendations||Ambiance - Magical atmosphere, incredible evening, Omar Phoenix playing the violin on Christmas Eve"
"I get takeout here all the time!

The Tom Kha soup is one of my favorites and it's really good here! The only downside is that you have to order rice and it isn't included in the price of the soup.

The soup has a lot of mushrooms in it here so if you are not a fan of those, I would not recommend. Also I will add that sometimes the mushrooms look like the chicken / it was hard for me to distinguish so I wouldn't count on being able to pick them out!

I have never actually eaten at the Restaurant, but it looks nice! It's in a sort of apartment complex strip, I'm guessing they have retail parking since spots are pretty limited, but I would double check before coming next.","Food - Tom Kha soup (favorite, rice not included, lots of mushrooms, hard to distinguish mushroom from chicken)||Location - in an apartment complex strip||Parking - limited parking spots"
"The ambiance of the restaurant was amazing. Wall was lined with sansaverrias and good mood lighting. Large wine rack decor in the middle of the restaurant floor. Service was good and attentive keeping our waters topped off. Wait time to get a seat was a bit long, but plenty of space outside to wait.

Came here for my dad's belated birthday and he was able to get a dessert which was this decadent taro flan.  But first started off the meal with the spicy Saigon chicken wings. They had a real nice crispy skin and right amount of fire. Then had duck four season which was served with lychee and longan for that sweet and savory taste. No bao buns like your usual Peking duck dishes. But the duck was cooked nicely and still really moist. We got the salted pepper shrimp, pineapple fried rice, and oxtail pho since my dad really wanted to try the oxtail. He was thoroughly impressed even though he knows how to make his own pho at home. The meat falls off the bone and the broth tasted rich yet clean. Fried rice wasn't a big portion and served in a pineapple but still really good fried rice!

Overall enjoyed my experience and would be back if I lived in Austin!","Food - Spicy Saigon chicken wings (nice crispy skin, right amount of fire), Duck four season (cooked nicely, moist), Salted pepper shrimp (impressive), Pineapple fried rice (good, small portion), Oxtail pho (impressive, rich yet clean broth)||Ambiance - Amazing, sansaverrias lining the walls, good mood lighting, large wine rack decor||Service - Good, attentive"
"Soup Dumplings were very good. The tofu summer roll was easily the best I've ever had. I don't do them often because they aren't usually so flavorful. Green curry was great. Had a healthy curry sweat as I wrapped up my dinner. Wine list vast, as the drink list and deserts. Next time I will get more into those parts of the menu and the live music nights sound right up my alley.

"The food is soooo good! I'm kind of picky in terms of Asian fusion, but 1618 actually did the fusion pretty good. It kept the original taste of all the dishes that we ordered. The Yellow Curry with Shrimp is very good, very Thai in my opinion, as well as the pepper steak, very Chinese. Good quality meal in a nice restaurant. The live music is great, not too loud, which is perfect. I really enjoyed the music and the food. I have to say the boss has a pretty good taste.
Hmmmm, coconut fried rice is over priced. You could order something better at this price.

"It was my last day in Austin and my friends decided to come here for one last chow for me.

It definitely wasn't a disappointment and I would definitely come back here.

I ordered their beef rib pho and Holy mother of all that's delicious....it was quite divine. The meat was tender and literally slid right off the bone. The fact that they pour the broth in front of you is a plus because I actually like a nice show with my food lol.

I do recommend everyone to give them a try, it's definitely worth it","Food - Beef rib pho (divine, tender meat, broth poured in front adds to experience)"
"Service was phenomenal- shout out to Emily!

Came here for lunch with a group (total of 4 people) and it was a majority of our first time here. Emily served us and made great recommendations, this review would be all about her if I kept talking about her.

In my very own opinion I'd say that the food was average, good but average, and the service/nature of the restaurant made it 4 stars.

I ordered Calamari and Orange Chicken. Calamari was great, orange chicken was good. The rice was SO bland. I mean I get it, it's just white rice, but I've had better. The chicken, for me, could have been a TAD more crispy but I'm just being picky. It's probably the best portion of chicken I've had whenever ordering orange chicken. It wasn't over powered by breading.

My friend ordered salmon and said it was a great portion size and very tasty he left very full and satisfied.

The only true negative I'll mention is there were a decent amount of flies. When we first arrived there weren't that many. I think as more people arrived towards the end of our meal flies just kept flying in. Not sure if this is something they can truly control. But it was bothersome.

Overall 1618 is worth a second visit and for a different meal. I'll definitely have the calamari again though.","Food - Calamari (great), Orange Chicken (good, bland rice), Salmon (great portion size, very tasty), Rice (bland)||Service - Phenomenal, great recommendations"

The shrimp and pork shu mai was also very good and it comes in 3 pieces. The scallion pancakes were perfectly textured. I got the Saigon lamb rack and omg the flavoring of the lambs alone was so good but the salad and the sauce to dip made it even better. My friend got the filet mignon pho and the broth was just ready to eat and didn't require anything additional.

"Once again we enjoyed some more delicious food, drinks and service from a truly amazing and dedicated team who always make us feel like a part of their family.  In addition they are also one of the restaurants participating in the Dine for Maui project to help those who have been devastated by wildfires on the island.
Thanks to the entire team for providing us with another wonderful experience. It's always heartwarming to see the diversity of the people who come together here.

"Food: excellent. Everyone at our table was satisfied. I enjoyed each dish we ordered. For a place that serves dim sum, they should really give you sauces for dipping on the side but the don't. When I asked our waitress she ended up giving me siracha and the brown plum sauce. Lol. Make it make sense.

Service: our waitress was great! She was super attentive. Brought everything at once and did well with the suggestions.

Ambiance:  this is the spot!","Food - dim sum (excellent)||Service - attentive, helpful with suggestions||Ambiance - great"

"Came here with my in-laws who were visiting from Miami.
Great tasting food at a decent price!
Good serving sizes as well!
The waitress was very kind and knowledgeable!
Although it was very loud, it wasn't too horrible!
Would definitely come back again with friends.","Food - Great||Service - Kind, knowledgeable||Ambiance - Loud but bearable"
"Love this place. Everything I've gotten has always been great but my tops are the orange chicken and the pork egg rolls with fish sauce. They also have great cocktails! Overall 10/10, food, service, ambiance (especially for a date night/special occasion/just to grab drinks with friends).","Food - Orange chicken (great), Pork egg rolls with fish sauce (great)||Ambiance - Great for various occasions||Service - Great, attentive"
"Easy five star spot! 3rd time here. Came here for lunch and dinner. That's how great it is!

Food: top notch. The pad Thai is really good. Full of flavor. The oxtail pho is so dam good. Also we really enjoyed the sesame chicken and general Tsos chicken. The dumplings were good as well. The filet mignonette beef stir fry was good.

We will definitely stop at this spot every single time we are in Austin. The service is great. The ambiance is nice. We will definitely come back here for years to come.

Very happy with this place.","Food - Pad Thai (full of flavor), Oxtail pho (excellent), Sesame chicken (good), General Tso's chicken (good), Dumplings (good), Filet mignonette beef stir fry (good)||Service - Great||Ambiance - Nice"
"I wasn't the biggest fan of how cramped the tables felt, especially with how hot it was outside and inside. And there were a lot of flies that kept flying around. But our server was amazing and the food was pretty decent!

I had the panang curry and it was the perfect balance of sweet and spicy, and had a good amount of shrimp in it. The rice didn't taste that fresh because it was kind of dry and clumpy, but you can't really tell when you mix it with the curry.

Sadly, we didn't try any of their famous pho because it was so hot out, but will definitely try that as well as some of their desserts next time I find myself in that area.","Food - Panang curry (perfect balance of sweet and spicy), Shrimp curry (good), rice (not fresh)||Service - Amazing||Ambiance - Cramped tables, hot environment, flies"
"This restaurant was such a good experience. From planning it with the event planner via email to being helped by the hostess and staff.

When my group got there, we was immediately greeted by the front staff. Told them I have been communicating with the event planner to have the semi private room reserved for 17 guest. The hostess asked if we wanted the private room
Because they spoke to the manager. I said yes of course if it's available.

I know serving 17 guest at a table will be hard but kudos to our waitress, she was amazing! Very professional and was very attentive. Im so glad I chose this place for breakfast.

FOOD : their pho broth is so good... It's both rich and clean. They use the flat pho noodles you see in Vietnam (more traditional) compare to the thin ones you see at other places. Most at the table got the Pho Beef Rib with filet mignon. For $22? Such a steal. I do wish that they gave more pho noodles... But overall, it's one of the best pho I ever had. We ordered so many apps from Shu Mai to crispy shrimp balls, so excited I forgot to take pictures!

DRINKS : we tried the Smokey old fashioned. For $20? It was ok. I can't complain because usually Old Fashioned go for $20. I didn't really taste the Smokey ness..

Overall, if I'm In the area, I would definitely come back. Highly recommend it!","Food - Pho broth (rich and clean), Pho beef rib with filet mignon (excellent)||Drinks - Smokey old fashioned (not great)||Service - Professional, attentive"
"If you haven't been here this is your SIGN! Somehow after two years in Austin I hadn't had time to check this place out and boy am I regretting it!

Decent amount of free parking near the Amli, we didn't have any issues finding a spot. The place itself feels kind of tucked away, yet you wander in upon this oasis.

The space itself is open and filled with live plants everywhere and beautiful decor. The staff was extremely attentive, friendly, and provided great suggestions around popular dishes or their personal favorites. We had Eric and he was phenomenal!

For the meal we ordered the chicken dumplings, yellow curry, pad Thai, and the appetizer assortment bc who doesn't love apps! I can't even describe the flavors, the curry was some of the best curry I've had hands down. The app platter was 100% the way to go, lots of food, not too expensive, and you get to try one or two of each item!

I will be back and will be bringing family friends you name it, this place is a gem in Austin.","Food - Chicken dumplings (solid, packed with flavor), Yellow curry (best curry), Pad Thai (powerful flavor), Appetizer assortment (favorite)||Service - Extremely attentive, friendly, great suggestions||Ambiance - Open, filled with live plants, beautiful decor"

"This is my second time here. I love this place so much. I love the food, the flavor is so so yum. The flavors are so scrumptious and I can't wait to return again. The ambiance is so so nice. They had live music on Thursday night. It was really entertaining. The waiter was so nice and explained all the desserts so well. Really liked the service. We ordered chicken dumplings as an appetizer, i ordered the salted pepper shrimp and it was my husbands birthday so we got the chocolate mousse cake. Everything came out warm and at a good time. Cant wait to keep returning to this gem in Austin!","Food - Chicken dumplings (nice and plump), Salted pepper shrimp (tasty), Chocolate mousse cake (favorite)||Ambiance - Nice, live music||Service - Nice waiter, thorough explanation"
"Tried this restaurant and absolutely loved the food. Overall quality of the food was so good. Absolutely delicious. The service was great, as soon as we were seated we were asked if we are returning or new to the restaurant. Following this the menu was throughly explained to us and any questions I had. Great service and explanation to the menu! For an appetizer i got the chicken dumpling. Great dumpling and yummy filling inside. For my drink i ordered the iced thai tea. It was a hit! I got the pad thai and it was really yum. The serving size was a great portion ( had leftovers i could take home) The flavor was powerful and i really enjoyed my meal. I will for sure be a returning customer. Loved it, a must try if your want asian fusion.","Food - Iced Thai tea (favorite), Chicken dumplings (great), Pad Thai (yum, powerful flavor)||Service - Great, thorough explanation"
"I'm definitely adding this to my list of place I must go to whenever I'm in Austin. The food and drinks were amazing!

I started off with the 1618 shrimp and pork egg rolls. They were solid and packed plenty of flavor.

For my main I has the Tom Yum Coconut Fried Rice.  This was some of the best fried rice I've ever had. It was the perfect portion size, the shrimp were massive and it was so damn good! I love the presentation in the coconut, although it does make it a bit difficult to cut up the shrimp.

My cousin had the Shrimp Panang Curry and it was really good.

We also enjoyed the mimosa special they offer during lunch. It's not advertised but the hostess mentioned it when seating us.

Overall service was good. It took a while for the waitress to  take our order but otherwise no complaints.

The inside is also really nice. I definitely enjoyed the vibe.

They have an expansive menu with different items from different parts of Asia. You're not limited to one particular region which is what I really enjoyed.

I'm looking forward to returning and trying the dim sum brunch.","Food - Shrimp and pork egg rolls (favorite), Tom Yum Coconut Fried Rice (best), Shrimp Panang Curry (really good)||Ambiance - Nice vibe, filled with live plants||Service - Good, slow to take order"
"The $50 I spent on food, I received 4 SPOONFULS of rice, grossly overcooked orange chicken, egg rolls that were of laughable proportions and red curry that had zero spice. No sauces were in my order. First and last time I'm ever ordering from here.","Food - Rice (Small portion), Orange chicken (overcooked), egg rolls (laughable proportions), Red curry (unflavorful)"
"Love this place. We went here for Sunday brunch to celebrate my Birthday. We had Soup Dumplings, Filet mignon Curry & Red Snapper w/ their special sauce on the side, to ensure the fish stayed crispy We also had dessert w/ a tableside show Flaming Cheesecake & they also gave me a Key-lime pie compliments of the restaurant for my Birthday. We look forward to coming again when we visit Austin","Food - Soup Dumplings (great), Filet Mignon Curry (great), Red Snapper with special sauce (great), Flaming Cheesecake (good)"
"The food was phenomenal. I made reservations for 2 in the evening and we came a little early but they still got us a table and everything we ordered was great ! The dragonfruit refresher was so good ! We also had the 5 sampler, watermelon duck salad and crispy pad Thai steak. The meat was so tender and full of flavor I will be coming back for sure when I visit again !

Management even came to check and see how everything was and had a good laugh as well.","Food - Yellow curry (favorite), Thuk (great)||Service - Sweet, knowledgeable, personal experience"
"Full of savory!

Went to this place for dumplings but we end up ordering General Tso and Duck Red Curry. General Tso was one of the favorites and never had a good General Tso like this here in Texas. It hits all the criteria - the freshness, the spice, the crispy chicken, and the sauce! On the other hand, duck red curry was as legit as it can taste. Been jumping to different asian restaurants and we can say this is one of our top asian restaurants.

We really enjoyed the place from the food, service, and the ambiance. The food was worthy of the price and the portion was enough. It is very neat and clean, good for casual or formal gathering.","Food - General Tso Chicken(fresh, crispy), Duck Red Curry (legit)||Ambiance - Nice, good for gatherings||Service - Good"
"This is truly an amazing restaurant!
Great customer service and superb flavor in all their cuisine.
I can't believe we don't have this in LA!

Pineapple fried rice is not too spicy but the spices used really entice your palate.

Chicken dumplings were nice and plump and packed fresh ingredients that didn't disappoint.

The top dish was the cheesecake flambÃƒÂ© because it was an experience. You can taste every bit of flavor down to the flame! This is to die for!

I'll definitely come back when I visit Austin again.","Food - Pineapple fried rice (enticing), Chicken dumplings (plump and fresh), Cheesecake flambé (flavorful)||Service - Great"
"This is just a cute place in downtown! The decor is very modern and the servers are very helpful and friendly.
Family decided to start with the five sampler and we were amazed. Everything, I repeat everything was delicious! From the skewers that had a very different sauce to the spring rolls, which we usually are not fans as we had never found one that has real taste, but this one is really good.
For mains, the family decided to go with the pad Thai and the duck fried rice. The duck was perfectly cooked with crispy skin and tender meat. It was also well seasoned. For the pad Thai, the server mentioned that the spice level was a 2 out of 5, but we'd say it was a 3. If you're not very familiar with spicy flavor what h out for this one. Portions are big and presentation is very good.
My daughter also ordered the cafe and she liked it.
A big bonus: this place is pet friendly! Seeing some dogs in the main dining room brought a huge smile to my face! Kiddos to the owners.

"To start off, 1618 had some of the best service I've experienced in a while. We were seated promptly without a reservation and shown to a roomy table in the middle of the dining area.

The interior is beautiful with a mix of hard and soft surfaces making it conducive to hearing your dinner guests instead of feeling like you're in an echo chamber. The lighting and music were set reasonably, which was an added bonus.

The food was very good. Everything was served at the proper temperature with dipping sauces (my favorite!) to balance each bite. The orange chicken was not too sweet, and definitely not spicy. The duck skewers were a great value for the money and were my personal favorite of the dishes we had.","Food - Orange chicken (great), Duck skewers (great value, favorite)||Ambiance - Beautiful interior, conducive for conversations||Service - Prompt seating, attentive"

"To start, we ordered the calamari and the dragonfruit rose refresher, both of which were delightful. The calamari was perfectly crispy and flavorful, while the refreshing dragonfruit rose refresher was a great choice to complement our appetizer.

For my main dish, I opted for the Pineapple Fried Rice, and it was absolutely delicious. The combination of juicy pineapple, tender rice, and well-balanced flavors made it a standout dish. I thoroughly enjoyed every bite!

What made the experience even better was the exceptional service from our waiter. They were genuinely nice, attentive, and ensured that we had everything we needed throughout our meal. Their friendly and professional approach added to the overall enjoyment of our dining experience.

The ambiance of 1618 Fusion was also noteworthy. The music playing in the background created a pleasant atmosphere, and the overall vibe of the restaurant was on point. It contributed to a relaxed and enjoyable evening.","Food - Calamari (crispy and flavorful), Dragonfruit rose refresher (refreshing), Pineapple fried rice (delicious)||Service - Exceptional service from waiter, friendly and professional||Ambiance - relaxed, enjoyable "

"1618

1618 is hands down one of the best restaurants in Austin.

I have been here probably 10-15 times by now and the food never disappoints.

They have an unbelievably good happy hour ($6 cocktails!) and the food is overflowing with flavor.

I have had just about everything here but i would recommend going with a Curry (yellow is my favorite) and either Pad Thai or a Filet Mignon Stir Fry.

The desserts are nothing to be missed too. I have had the chocolate cake (not the exploding lava one) and it is just immaculate.

Probs to this family owned business for making an unbelievably tasty offering at a solid price point! The atmosphere is so great as the restaurant is packed 24/7!","Food - Yellow Curry (recommended), Pad Thai (recommended), Filet Mignon Stir Fry(recommended), Chocolate cake (immaculate)||Ambiance - Packed restaurant, great atmosphere"

"I usually never leave yelp reviews but wanted to leave one for my girl Shaira who was so great in terms of the service. The vibe is amazing, you will love it here. Great for dates, literally anything I came alone and had a great time. I had the five sampler because I wanted some bao buns and honestly I took a chance because I don't really eat meat. I didn't enjoy it much but I think it really just depends on what you like. I did enjoy the calamari very tasty. The THAI ICED TEA AND THE MANGO STICKY RICE were literally TO DIE FOR. Highly suggest those. Thank you Shaira and to this place for great late night vibes. Shaira did say the crispy chicken pad Thai was bomb and I didn't get to try but honestly I suggest it lol. I know it would be good","Food - Five Sampler(good), Calamari (very tasty), Thai Iced Tea and Mango Sticky Rice (highly recommended)||Service - excellent, amazing vibe"
"If they have a membership program, I'll probably become a gold member soon. I come here every week and try out new dishes every time.
Eruption chocolate: huge portion. You might want to share it with someone. It's not a 5-star though. There's not much chocolate oozing out of the cake. It's a little bit too sweet.
Crab fried rice with truffle: it's not on their regular menu. You will find it on happy hour menu. It's amazing. The portion is not too big, but it's an enjoyable size","Food - Eruption chocolate (huge portion, bit too sweet), Crab fried rice with truffle (amazing)||Ambiance - Enjoyable"
"Duck curry: yummy. Perfectly balanced. It's not too greasy. I wish there's more duck meat though.

Coconut fried rice: coconut smell overwhelmed in a good way.

Duck dumpling noodle: it's a 6/5 dish. There's nothing to complain about. It's authentic. Again, I wish there's more duck meat though, but duck is pricey to begin with, so I understand why they didn't put too much in.

Pho 75 during happy hour: BE AWARE. the portion is for kid (or merely an appetizer for an adult). The bowl is super tiny. I can't complain on the quality though, it's not authentic but still super tasty.

Mount Everest Cheesecake: it comes with a show. They burned the wine on the cheesecake and then extinguished the fire with ice cream. It's super delicious though. It's a bit pricey but you will get a whole show. I say it's so worth the price.","Food - Duck curry (yummy, perfectly balanced), Coconut fried rice (pleasant coconut aroma), Duck dumpling noodle (authentic, exceptional), Pho 75 (small portion, tasty), Mount Everest Cheesecake (delicious, bit pricey)"
"I think I made a bad choice, Both dishes are full of coconut flavors, so together it's super fatty (in a good way though).
This is a nice fancy Asian restaurant, but the price is still very reasonable for the quality.
The restaurant is huge. It's well decorated.
10/10 for the service. Everyone is friendly, from the host to the server to the bartender. There's nothing to complain.
I'll be back to try the Peking Duck and the dessert.
I saw a plate of lava cake and ice cream, it look too good to be true, unfortunately I was to full to try it. There will be a next time.","Food - super fatty||Service - perfect, friendly||Ambiance - well decorated||Price - reasonable"

Our server Ana was very friendly and accommodating. Thank you.","Food - Pad Thai (Delicious, right amount of tangy, spicy, crunchy)||Service - friendly, accommodating"
"At this point, I'd consider myself a regular. 1618 is always one of the places I recommend friends visit and it's always somewhere I bring family.

The food is not too expensive, the ambiance is relaxed but lively and the staff is amazing - especially Christian and our waitress!

The Calamari is amazing and they have the best duck! I'll definitely be back.","Food - Calamari (amazing), Duck (best)||Service - Amazing||Ambiance - relaxed, lively"
"This unassuming strip mall (with limited retail parking) under the AMLI apartment building off Riverside Drive went under my radar for far too long! I'd ordered some 1618 via ubereats, and when that went well (but not before showing up unannounced to discover this spot already had enough street cred to generate a sizeable wait time), we called ahead and found free spots at the bar one night to have our maiden in-person experience here!  

From the dÃƒÂ©cor to the hospitality, the mood was set. Loved the interesting lines of the interior design and the wine room in the midst of the dining room! There's even a stay for... live music and other acts?! Yesss!

And on to the food. Since we'd had to wait a hot minute, we decided to share a smattering of options. And when I say this place has food on par with Lin Dim Sum and Julie's Noodles, I MEAN IT!

The scallion pancakes are instantly (and maybe permanently) my favorite of anywhere I've had them. Usually super-thin and crispy and far from substantial, the scallion pancakes here were pillowy-soft, dimensional, and oh so divine!  Will ALWAYS get more in the future! -- 14/10

The pork, shrimp & shiitake Sui Mai (3-pc order) were ample and well filled, but I've just never been big on this flavor combo, though I'd still say they were ""pretty good"" -- 8/10

Now dem Xiao Long Bao (5-pc order)... holy pork soup dumplings on a spoon...!  I'd say on par IF NOT BETTER THAN Lin/ Julie's. Bigger bite for sure, and I think I could easily take down a few orders solo!  Definitely contenders here, and they've got these on the Dim sum brunch menu for a STEAL at $11! -- 14/10

The clay pot sticky rice I was ""meh"" about, I think mainly because I'm not big on Chinese sausage... but my honey liked it quite a lot!  -- 7/10 (for me)

Mango sticky rice was served beautifully, but I didn't love it. I dunno why... I'll try it once more before I even rate it..  maybe it just failed to be amazing following one of the best desserts of my life--

The Flambeau Everest cheesecake, fired with vanilla honey liqueur, cinnamon is sprinkled over it as the flames engulf the plate & topped with a scoop of coconut pineapple ice cream...... OK I need to go get another one soon after describing it alone!  I am a cheesecake aficionado, and this one absolutely, unequivocally takes the LITERAL cake!  What a whirlwind of unexpectedly epic deliciousness on a spoon!  -- 15/10

Seriously.
Deliriously.
Divine!","Ambiance - Interesting interior design, live music||Food - Scallion pancakes (favorite), pork, shrimp & shiitake Sui Mai (ample, well filled), Xiao Long Bao (delicious), Sticky rice (meh), Mango sticky rice (beautifully presented, didn't like), Flambeau Everest cheesecake (delicious)||Service - Great"
"Took my family for an early Mother's Day. The live music was amazing and created an amazing vibe for the restaurant. It is such a homey yet up-scale place that was beautiful.

We ordered calamari and grilled octopus. The batter for the calamari is soooo good and the salt,pepper,lemon dip adds the best type of flavor. The grilled octopus was on a stick and had a good Smokey flavor. Both great. We also ordered the papaya salad with shrimp. It was very refreshing and crunchy with the fish sauce smell but not super overpowering fish sauce taste. Very good!

For mains we got the L redfish and duck fried rice. So so so good. Only thing is I wish the tables were a little bigger since their food is a lot of family style options. But the food was amazing. The redfish belly was so so caramelized and crispy. I will now always crave this. The fried rice was good flavor. Very authentic since I'm very picky about fried rice. I was able to take both's leftovers to go and it was just as good the next day. We also got some stir fry which has good flavor and came with white rice.

We ended with the flaming cheesecake. Our server did it table side and it was an entertainment in itself. Very good and light.

Our server was great as all. Very attentive. The place is pretty busy so he was always running around, but overall he was able to answer all our questions and keep us satisfied for dinner.

Highly recommend this place","Food - Calamari (delicious batter), Grilled octopus (good smokey flavor), Papaya salad (refreshing), L Redfish (caramelized, crispy), duck fried rice (amazing), stir fry (good flavor), flaming cheesecake (very good, light)||Ambiance - Homey yet upscale, live music, great vibe||Service - Great, attentive"
"Management - Please Read! Nobody needs or wants to hear a violin at 1000 decibels as they try to have dinner on a Thursday night in an Asian restaurant. It's piercing, it's annoying. Even worse it's so off tune. The severs are yelling at you. The music is way over amplified. If I wanted to go see a concert I'd be at a concert. Otherwise I love this place and I'm so bummed that management lacks any sort of sense of what a guest wants to experience when coming out for a nice dinner. This is TOO much.",Ambiance - music is too loud and off-tune

"The food was ok, but nothing spectacular. I have probably been spoiled by Cali Asian cuisine. I have had much better. Don't let the high ratings fool you too.

We ordered the appetizer sampler. My companion hated the pork and gave them all to me. I thought the best item was the egg rolls but how can you screw those up. Papaya salad was good but again, pretty standard Asian fare.

Service was ok. Server was a bit robotic when we were asking for recommendations.

Restrooms were nice but smelled weird. Skip and go to some place else.","Food - appetizer sampler (mixed reviews), Papaya salad (good), Egg rolls (best item), Pork (hated)||Service - Okay, robotic server"
"1618 Asian Fusion is an upscale Asian fusion restaurant that takes the best parts of common Asian dishes and elevates them.  This is not your mom's Vietnamese pho, and that's a good thing.  Some purists may not like the elevated twists, but to me 1618 is worth a visit.

My Overall Rating - 4 Stars (Atmosphere, Service, Food, Return)

Atmosphere - On the outside, 1618 Asian Fusion is as unassuming as it's name.  But inside it's a large, open space.  There's a desk dedicated to To Go orders (expertly packaged), and a stage that features live entertainment.  We were treated to a fantastic acoustic set which really accentuated the cool vibe.  1 Star.

Service - Our server was very good.  Attentive, friendly, and a great conversationalist.  No issue at all.  I would have liked the servers to explain the dishes that we ordered, since this is a high end restaurant with unique dishes.  1/2 Star.

Food - The word Fusion is in the name of the restaurant because Asian Fusion serves dishes inspired from many Southeast Asian Countries like Vietnam and Thailand.  I started with the Fried Calamari, which is served in a traditional Vietnamese style. The outside was light and crispy.  I loved it because it was the perfect example of taking a traditional dish and elevating it.  The Pho Rib is served with huge beef ribs and the pho broth is poured over in a tea kettle.  Again, this is not your mom's pho.  It was elevated and familiar at the same time.  The only letdown was the Pineapple Fried Rice.  It was just ok - order it for your IG feed, not your belly.  I have to give a bonus shout out to the To Go order.  We ordered a Pho Combo to go, and they expertly packaged it up.  Finally, Asian Fusion isn't cheap.  Don't except to eat the pho every day.  1  1/2 Stars.

Will I Return? - Yes.  The atmosphere is great.  The service is great.  The food is familiar and unique at the same time.  There are many more dishes I want to try.  I'll be back. 1 Star.

My Yelp Rating Scale (Sum of all parts):
1 Star - Atmosphere - Is it a cool dive?  Perhaps an upscale place?  No matter the type, atmosphere plays a big part and I'll give a star if I like it or thinks it has great charm.
1 Star - Service - You can have a great meal with bad service.  But that's also what can make a five star joint drop to four.  It's important to the dining experience that service is great and on point.
2 Stars - Food - I'll award up to two stars for the food, since this is the main reason we dine out.  Sometimes the extra star is given for value, but it's really all about the food.
1 Star - Will I come back? - If I know for a fact I'll return, I'll give this a star. A place has to make an impression for me to return.

Each Category can be given up to 1 star except food (2 stars) because I consider all these categories important to the overall dining experience.  I will sum them up to provide my final Yelp score.","Food - Fried Calamari (perfect example of taking a traditional dish and elevating it), Pho Rib (elevated yet familiar), Pineapple Fried Rice (just ok), Pho Combo (expertly packaged)||Ambiance - Large, open space, live entertainment||Service - Attentive, friendly, didn't explain the dishes"

"Very solid! I was a bit skeptical to be honest given the fusion aspect of this place with its broad pan-Asian menu but consider me impressed! The oxtail in the oxtail pho was cooked well and the meat was incredibly tender. I'm looking forward to trying the beef rib pho next time (though I might need to show a bit earlier since apparently they run out of it).

My friend had the crispy chicken pad Thai and I thought that dish was definitely a standout. I normally am not big on pad Thai but in all honesty, it didn't taste like pad Thai at all (which to me was a good thing). It was definitely a crispy version of something Thai-tasting but without the sour flavors of fish sauce and vinegar, so maybe more like a crispy pad woon sen or crispy pad thai? Either way, it was A+.","Food - Oxtail pho (cooked well with tender meat), Crispy chicken pad Thai (standout, not like traditional pad Thai, very delicious)"
"After my first visit I wasn't sure if I would return, I did. And I couldn't be more pleased! The dragon fruit drink was beyond delicious! The jasmine syrup was a bit too much. The spices were absolutely DIVINE! The waitstaff was attentive, respectful and all round stellar.
The only negative was the packed house was extremely hot. And the flamed drinks and burning of spice over cheesecake was difficult to tolerate. Being an asthmatic it was difficult to enjoy meal but I pushed through. I would ask they be mindful of guest that can't inhale smoke or are allergic to toxic smoke from burning food items. Covering the windows make eliminate excessive heat. Otherwise a well worth visit!","Food - Dragon fruit drink (beyond delicious, jasmine syrup a bit too much, spices DIVINE)||Service - Attentive, respectful||Ambiance - Nice, extremely hot inside"

"1618 is great! A few stand out dishes I've had are the Vietnamese bowl with pork and egg rolls, and the soup dumplings. The soup dumpling broth was SO flavorful. Some of the classic dishes like sesame chicken and orange chicken aren't really worth the upcharge of it being in a more upscale restaurant since it tastes the same as any other Asian restaurant really. Ambiance is nice - we went on a Friday night and there was live music. Definitely a must visit for Asian food in Austin!","Food - Vietnamese bowl with pork and egg rolls (standout), Soup dumplings (flavorful broth), sesame chicken and orange chicken (not worth upcharge)||Ambiance - Nice, live music"

"I heard 1618 Asian Fusion is the sister restaurant to 888 Pan Asian Restaurant, so I had to try it out!

Coming in, the service is amazing. We checked in through our reservations made on Yelp and we're seated immediately. If you were a walk-in, there was about an hour wait. The restaurant was fancy and very nice, we also had live music! What I loved about the live music was that it wasn't so loud to where my table couldn't hear each other, it was great!

My family ordered Mi Kho, Filet Mignon Pepper Steak, Combo Fried Rice, Thai Crispy Red Snapper (size L). From all of the food we ate, the Thai Crispy Red Snapper was the best; It was large, crispy, and the tamarind sauce was yummy! The Filet Mignon Pepper Steak came second, the steak was delicious. The conbo fried rice was okay, not the best but good. The Mi Kho unfortunately was not the greatest; The sauce was too strong and it just tasted like someone poured a lot of soy sauce and the pork belly was off, it tasted like tofu.

Overall, I would come back to try more different items like their pho (which they're known for)! I would recommend the Red Snapper for sure :)","Food - Thai Crispy Red Snapper (best, large, crispy, yummy tamarind sauce), Filet Mignon Pepper Steak (delicious), Combo Fried Rice (good), Mi Kho (not the greatest, sauce too strong, port belly was off)||Ambiance - Fancy, live music, not too loud"
"Food (5/5 stars):
1618 Asian Fusion made it to Yelp's Top 100 US Restaurants list, so we had to try even though we had to get takeout and eat it on the plane  Their Pad Thai was an explosion of flavor -- citrus, spice, nutty, savory, sweet. And the tofu was cooked very well. It wasn't my absolute favorite Pad Thai, but it was still amazing and would want to try their eclectic range of dishes when I'm back in Austin.

Experience (5/5 stars):
* Price: kinda pricey, but worth
* Wait Time: we scheduled our takeout and it was on time
* Service: very good and friendly
* Ambiance: it's a nice, modern restaurant!","Food - Pad Thai (explosion of flavor, favorite), Tofu (cooked very well)||Price - high||Service - very good||Ambiance - nice, modern"
"Definitely late to the party coming here but so glad we did make it here on Valentine's Day. The place was decorated with hearts and 80's ballads were playing.

We started off with the 1618 egg rolls. Love the presentation of the dish and the egg rolls are definitely not what I expected. The rolls were tasty and crispy. Next, we tried the soup dumplings. Delicious. I like that they gave us a plate with sauces to dip in. Presentation was definitely on point with the next dishes. We tried the Tom yum fried rice, four seasons duck and pepper steak. Everything was full of flavor and I was worried about the duck being sweet with the lychee. It was not at all. It was very good. I am always afraid of trying Asian fusion places, but this place knows what they are doing. Presentation and flavor did not come short. They offer free garage parking.","Food - 1618 egg rolls (tasty and crispy), Soup dumplings (delicious, flavorful broth and sauces), Tom yum fried rice (flavorful), four seasons duck (flavorful), pepper steak (flavorful)"

Do I need to say more? We have visited the restaurant a few times, and always had exactly the same top-notch experience. This restaurant does not have an ""off"" night. During one of our visits, we chatted with a waitress who said she's been working there for a few years and has no plans on leaving because she's been treated right by the owners. That just shows how good management trickles into all aspects of the business.

"1618 is always a solid restaurant. I remember the first time I went years ago, I was a bit skeptical as anything fusion usually tends to not be good when you try to do everything... 1618 is the exception to this. Despite doing a span of different Asian dishes, everything's is always consistently good. I have had their chicken red curry (beautifully plated with unexpected mushrooms), Peking duck (one of the best I've had, filet mignon pho (the most tender cut I'd meat), crispy fish (really unique with DIY rice rolls), among others...

I have also been for dim sum, which while good, is a bit overpriced. I prefer their regular menu.","Food - Chicken red curry (beautifully plated, unexpected mushrooms), Peking duck (one of the best), Filet mignon pho (tender), Crispy fish (unique with DIY rice rolls), Dim sum (good but overpriced)"
"This restaurant wholeheartedly deserves its spot on this year's Yelp 100.

I went last month for a business dinner while in Austin. It must have been at least a dozen of us, so they gave us a snazzy private room. We even had our own waitress, Jen, who somehow coordinated others to help her and we never wanted for anything.

So we went on a Wednesday on a reservation. Would probably suggest you making a reservation, especially given this restaurant's latest news of being on the Yelp 100. It is busy, busy!

On Wednesdays, they have some happy hour where you get major deals on wine. We did not partake, given the context of the dinner, but some did join in with a cocktail or two. I abstained. I'm admittedly not much of a drinker.

While I cannot tell you what every single person ordered, I can tell you that a month later, we are still dreaming about their soup dumplings. While I may have had some before, they don't compare to the ones at this restaurant. They are perfectly seasoned and just like having little savory marshmallows in your mouth (if such a thing exists, after all).

We had some other appetizers, mainly a platter with variety including other dumplings, fried goodies, and I forget what else. For our entrees, pho was quite popular, as were the noodle and rice dishes. I, myself, had a salt and pepper shrimp rice dish that I thought wouldn't fill me and I was deceived. It looks small, but it will fill you. The spicy sauce, too, was delectable.

For dessert, we had the chocolate mousse and a flaming cheesecake. The presentation for that flaming cheesecake was beautiful, and I recommend this if you like a show and love pineapple. I love a show but hate pineapple, so I took a bite and called it a day. The chocolate mousse in comparison while good wasn't a stunner; most, if not all minus me, preferred the cheesecake. Ultimately, this was my favorite restaurant in Austin and I would love to return, especially for those soup dumplings. Yum, yum.","Food - Soup dumplings (perfectly seasoned), Appetizers (variety), Salt and pepper shrimp rice (filling, delectable), flaming cheesecake (recommended), chocolate mousse (good, not a stunner)||Service - Coordinated, attentive"
"Ahhhhh omg, this place. Where to begin. The ambience was nice, slightly upscale but in a casual way. Very high quality food. Everything was very fresh, piping hot and well curated. M

Calamari- YOU MUST GET THIS. Is a small portion, maybe two people can share this. If more than 2 people get multiple orders cause you will want to scarf this down. If I had known how delicious it was I would have gotten like 3 orders for myself....they season it so well. Perfectly cooked. It practically melted in my mouth. They serve it with this really nice coconut milk based dipping sauce. YUM

Sesame chicken - very crunchy, very sticky, sweet and served with rice and grilled pineapple. DELICIOUS.

Lemongrass chicken vermicelli bowl- piping hot, perfectly cooked chicken. The lemongrass wasn't overpowering. The portion size was very big. I had to take half to go.

Soup dumplings- these were very underwhelming for me. Idk if it was just me but they were pretty bland and just meh. I had no interested in eating a second one.

Last but certainly not least, Chow, our server was THE BEST. such a sweet guy. We spent a lot of time talking to him. Very great guy with a really great head on his shoulders.

+The beef pho soup was pretty good; they served wide rice noodles like they do in Northern Vietnam.

-They did not have chili powder, vinegar with green chilies, or fish sauce with red chilies.

"We've been dining with these fine folks since summer 2021. Previously, their execution was flawless. We have now had two orders where this wasn't the case. The fried rice in last night's order would've been embarrassing if they had served it to a client of mine. The shrimp was old and the fried rice wasn't properly cooked.

They also don't actually reply to direct messages trying to seek discussion of this sort of problem.

I will no longer refer my clients to their establishment

I'm sad to see it go downhill like this","Food - fried rice (not properly cooked, shrimp was old)||Service - disappointing, unresponsive management"

"This is a late post, but I had an unforgettable experience there back in July. I was visiting from out of town and my cousin had recommended Qi Austin.  To be quite honest, it wasn't on my radar because I had come with an Austin foodie list of things to try but decided to proceed and  trust his judgement.

My party and I were served by Danny who was incredibly knowledgable and had the BEST recommendations for dinner. Drink knowledge was very impressive too. I had worked in the restaurant industry for over 10 years so I knew I was being helped by someone who was very good at their job. So we had full faith to have him decide pretty much our entire dinner. There were a couple of dishes we added to the list but the rest was taken care of by Danny. We enjoyed the food but we enjoyed the service even more. If we didn't have Danny as your server then we know we wouldn't have had the same memorable experience. Promote the man! He knows what he's doing!","Food - Enjoyed||Service - Exceptional, Great recommendations"
"Qi is a hidden gem that takes you on an authentic culinary journey through the diverse and exquisite flavors of China. Located in the heart of the city, this restaurant promises a memorable dining experience.

Our culinary journey began with an array of delectable appetizers. The Dim Sum Platter was a standout, featuring delicate dumplings filled with a variety of fillings, from succulent shrimp to flavorful pork. The pan-fried spring rolls were perfectly crispy, and the dipping sauces added a burst of flavor.

For the main course, we opted for a mix of dishes from different regions of China. The Peking Duck was a showstopper, with thin, crispy skin and tender meat. The traditional table-side carving added a touch of drama to the experience. The Sichuan Kung Pao Chicken packed a spicy punch with its fiery chili peppers, and the Mapo Tofu was a silky, spicy delight.

The Stir-Fried Shanghai Noodles showcased the chef's skill with wok cooking, and the flavors were spot-on. We also tried the fragrant Cantonese-style Steamed Fish, which was incredibly fresh and accompanied by a light ginger and soy sauce.

The restaurant boasts an extensive drink menu, including a variety of Chinese teas and a well-curated selection of wines and cocktails. We paired our meal with a fragrant jasmine tea that complemented the flavors perfectly.

Qi is a hidden treasure for those seeking an authentic Chinese dining experience. From the ambiance that transports you to China to the attentive service and the diverse, flavorful dishes, this restaurant is a must-visit for lovers of Chinese cuisine. The only reason for not awarding a full five stars is that, at times, the restaurant can be a bit crowded during peak hours. Nevertheless, it's a culinary journey worth embarking on.","Food - Dim Sum Platter (standout), Pan-fried spring rolls (crispy), Peking Duck (showstopper), Sichuan Kung Pao Chicken (spicy punch), Mapo Tofu (silky, spicy), Stir-Fried Shanghai Noodles (spot-on), Cantonese-style Steamed Fish (fresh)||Drinks - Extensive menu, Chinese teas"
"Chef Ling brings everything you love about Lin,  elevated. And unlike so many restaurants that suffer after opening multiple locations, Qi is every bit as consistent, with that high dining service and atmosphere.

Shanghai dumplings are like none else, if Michelin were in Texas these would be top of their list. I branched out this time and was able to try the Lobster dumpling, more subtle, slightly sweet, still layers of complexity. I've never had a potsticker knock my socks off - this one WILL - Akaushi beef seasoned with a touch of scallion, gently steamed and reminiscent of tartare, with a crispy crown of lacy wrapper, soaking up just the right ratio of sauce. A treat! Ingredients in the fried rice were generous and fresh, but the dish was generally under seasoned, leaving room for intervention. Noodles were much better. Egg drop soup is rich but light, with the most delightful texture of egg to contrast with little fresh kernels of corn. I had the spicy shrimp in air-battered tempura with scallions & jalapeÃƒÂ±os. Very simple, straightforward, but lovely, balanced, sweet, peppery, spicy, a delight. Danny is a lovely host, helped guide us through the menu and towards a Sancerre that cut the fats just right.

Aside from sharing lunch with friends, knowing the dim sum brunch is an even better way to tour around the menu, I love that Qi is a similarly appropriate venue for a casual business lunch as it is a sentimental occasion, or (recommended) taking the large table to sample every entree on the menu paired with very fine wine & sake selections with all your friends.","Food - Shanghai dumplings (top-notch), Lobster dumpling (subtle, slightly sweet), Potsticker (knockout), Fried rice (generous, fresh but under seasoned), Noodles (much better), Egg drop soup (rich but light),spicy shrimp in air-battered tempura with scallions & jalapenos (simple, straightforward, lovely, balanced, sweet, peppery, spicy, delight)||Service - lovely, Excellent recommendations"

The drinks were very good according to my party! And they were very attentive to us. Our server was supper knowledgeable on the dishes/drinks they had to offer.

Everything here is ""family"" portions so get it to share. The food was good, but it wasn't amazing. I have definitely had better. The soup dumplings came with a cup (usually a big spoon) that you drink the soup from, but the cup just made it a little harder to enjoy tie dumpling.

"My husband read about the @qiaustinrestaurant and wanted to celebrate his birthday early there. Made reservations for the Wu clan.

You know it's a true foodie who would drive 2 hours one way for good food! I'm surprised yet thankful for free parking in the garage. We started off with 2 different Soup Dumplings: Shanghai and Crab Meat Fish Maw. These were almost double the size of ones in San Antonio and contain a lot of soup!

We ordered the Peking Duck, Whole Red Snapper in soy ginger sauce, Truffle Egg Fried Rice, Combination Fried Rice, Braised Oxtail, Honey Akaushi Beef, Pork Belly (cooked 24 hours), Sesame Chicken, and Seasonal Vegetable with Bird Nest. I felt as if I was transported to NYC's Chinatown. Phenomenal food!

The 2 not-so-stellar dishes were the Honey Akaushi Beef and the Red Snapper. Some that had the beef had tender pieces, but I ended up with chewy ones. The fish was overcooked. Kris was an excellent server and the food came out quickly.

I'd probably skip out on the noodles next time, but everything was flavorful and delicious. FYI everything is served meant to share.

The restaurant is also gorgeous and they have enough seating for large groups if you reserve ahead of time. Another plus is an attached garage with free parking for dining guests.

"This place was highly rated when I was looking for a dm sum spot in Austin. It was also highly recommended by a friend as well to stop by try. Glad we listened and decided to come. So let's get this review started.

Ambience:

The place was very modern looking and especially the decor inside. I loved how it looked. Beautifully designed and pretty dark inside. The seating arrangement was sort of bunched together a bit. Oh my... the chairs were really exquisite. It was comfy but also the design was pretty nice. I just really loved their decor.

Service:

We went when it just opened, so it wasn't that bad. You could make a reservation ahead of time, but it wasn't necessary at the time we went. We were greeted by the host and then seated at a table when we entered. Our waitress was really lovely too. She was wonderful and helpful as well. She was a real delight. The way to order here is almost like a typical dim sum place. They give you a set menu and then you basically just mark down how many orders you want on the menu. Food came out pretty fast as soon as you place your order on the paper. So it wasn't that long of a wait to fill our bellies.

Food:

Oh the food! What can I say about the food. Absolutely wonderful. We enjoyed every dish that we ordered. We also ordered the typical items that we usually order at dim sum. Luckily they had the items we always ordered. Their menu for dim sum was a bit restricted, but it still had a good amount of variety to it. We ordered harrow, xis mai, bbq buns, custard buns and a lobster filled dumpling I believe. We got that one because it was in the shape of a rabbit. Very cute! We left here with full and satisfied.

Would we come again? Probably if we come back to Austin to visit.","Food - Har gow (enjoyed, satisfied), siu mai (enjoyed, satisfied), BBQ buns (enjoyed, satisfied), custard buns (enjoyed, satisfied), lobster filled dumplings (enjoyed, satisfied)||Ambiance - Modern, beautifully designed, dark, exquisite chairs, bunched seating||Service - Lovely, helpful, delightful, fast"
"If you're looking for some up-scale Chinese food, Qi can certainly hit the spot. First of all, the ambience is really nice. Note that you'll probably need a reservation ahead of time. But if you are a party of 1 or 2, there's almost always immediate seating at the bar or area in front of the kitchen.

I haven't tried everything off their menu, but there are some major hits everyone should try:

Basil Chicken Dumplings - For a dish that frankly sounds unassuming, these dumplings are a knockout. Must try if you want dumplings. The sauce that comes with it enhances it to another level.

Shrimp Har Gow - These are just done really well. The shrimp inside tastes fantastic and the texture of outer starchy skin is amazing. Probably the best Har Gow I've tried.

Honey Akaushi Beef -  WOW. If there is anything that makes Qi deserving of the 5 star review, it is this dish here. I have never had anything like this. The beef is cooked so perfectly, with a nice outer crust. Once you bite into it, it is like an explosion of delicious beef flavor.  And the sauce is this well balanced mixing of honey and pepper that hits all the senses. My parents visited me in Austin and they were so impressed by this dish as well.

My only gripe with this restaurant is their pekin duck entree. Everything tasted great, but they only provided ~3-4 bao to make your duck ""tacos."" And if you want more, you have to pay $1.50 for each extra bao! I'm not sure why they are nickle-and-diming so hard for this bread. Other Chinese restaurants give plenty.","Food - Basil Chicken Dumplings (knockout, sauce enhances), Shrimp Har Gow (done really well, fantastic shrimp), Honey Akaushi Beef (WOW, perfectly cooked beef, delicious flavor explosion), Pekin Duck (great taste, limited bao)||Ambiance - Nice||Service - great||Price - Extra charge for additional bao"
"Always a good time and good food when coming here! Plan ahead & Make sure you make reservations so you're not waiting because there will be a wait, especially on the weekends.

The service here is always amazing, I love that they have whiskey cocktails Available and they make them well! Everything I've tried here is pretty darn good but my favorites are the truffle fried rice, singapore crispy whole fish, and their imperial Tofu!

Trust me you won't be disappointed","Food - Truffle fried rice (pretty darn good), Singapore crispy whole fish (pretty darn good), Imperial Tofu (pretty darn good)||Service - Amazing"
"A culinary delight awaits at this establishment, accompanied by attentive staff who gladly elucidate the diverse menu offerings. I relished the truffle egg fried rice and Shanghai dumplings - both a perfect match for my palate.

"This restaurant has really yummy, cute food, mice devor and ambiance, and friendly staff. You can ask the waiter for what vegan options they have as they don't have a dedicated vegan menu, but can definitely male accomodations.

My friend likes getting the chicken rats or whatever they're made of. They are super cute!

I usually get vegan dumplings or salt and pepper tofu. Super yummy!","Food - vegan dumplings (yummy), salt and pepper tofu (yummy)||Ambiance - Nice décor||Service - Friendly, accommodating||Menu - No dedicated vegan menu"
"For me, Qi is a great spot for a variety of Dim Sum small plates, shareable entrees, and a cozy / dimly lit evening out.

I definitely recommend their house special soup dumplings, truffle fried rice, and the whole fish (photo attached). The presentation, portion sizes, and quality of food do not disappoint. I think it's a great spot for a date night, evening with colleagues/clients, or any time you want to splurge or impress.

Make a reservation in advance, and be sure to check in up front with the staff when you arrive! Plenty of complementary parking spots on the fourth floor of the adjacent garage behind the front of the restaurant.","Food - House special soup dumplings (great), Truffle fried rice (recommended), Whole fish (recommended)||Ambiance - Cozy and dimly lit||Parking - Complementary spots available"
"We really wanted soup dumplings, so we went for lunch and stopped by this place. This place is very nicely decorated. All the details are thought out to the smallest detail. We were not greeted with a smile, but were immediately asked if we had a reservation. The service was not very good. No one asked if we wanted drinks. The drinks we ordered never arrived and I had to ask for them a second time. The soup dumplings were actually very tasty. The entrees, on the other hand, were flat. We ordered the chicken with pine nuts and the Berkshire pork, but it was just not flavorful. Maybe we ordered it wrong. Hard to tell as the staff didn't give us any instructions.","Food - Soup dumplings (very tasty), Chicken with pine nuts (not flavorful), Berkshire pork (not flavorful)||Ambiance - Nicely decorated||Service - Lackluster, no smile, slow||Drinks - Ordered but never arrived"

"Upscale Chinese fusion restaurant with beautiful ambiance, but a hefty price tag. I've dined here twice and my opinion hasn't changed much. I've tried a number of dim sum appetizers here and the Shanghai soup dumplings continue to be the best relative to the other options. Although, in comparison with other pork soup dumplings I've had at different establishments, this one falls to the bottom. The dough is too thick and vastly overpowers the under-seasoned filling. $13 for 5 pieces is also on the steep side. The peking duck was acceptable. It came with a pate you spread across the bao for flavor. There are only 3 baos that come with the order so expect disproportionate portions. I prefer my peking duck be wrapped thin pancakes or wraps, but unfortunately they don't offer that here. I much prefer the duck at Bamboo House or Jade at a much reasonable cost with more authentic flavors. The truffle fried rice was very underwhelming. Something that can easily be made at home. The only toppings it consisted of were egg and maybe 2 shavings of truffle. For a restaurant that encourages family style meals, the pork belly was really the only dish that was abundant. Unfortunately, it was doused in a sauce that didn't highlight the protein. The bird nest was probably the best thing that was ordered during this visit. The vegetables were seasoned nicely and the nest it was held in provided a satisfying crunch.

For dessert, we got the mango bomb and the fly me to the moon. I found the mango bomb a bit too tart the more bites I took, but fly me to the moon was finished off in a blink of an eye. Overall, if you're looking to spend a pretty penny, there are plenty of other options to choose from with beautiful ambiance and better bang for your buck. If you're looking for more authentic flavors, best to look elsewhere.","Food - Shanghai soup dumplings (best relative to other options, falls to the bottom compared to other pork soup dumplings), Peking duck (acceptable, disproportionate portions for baos), Truffle fried rice (underwhelming, easily made at home, lacked toppings), Pork belly (doused in sauce that didn't highlight protein), Bird nest (best, seasoned vegetables, satisfying crunch), Mango bomb (bit too tart), Fly me to the moon (finished off quickly)||Ambiance - Beautiful, modern and traditional mix||Price - high||Service - superb"
"I was a little skeptical when my friend suggested ""upscale"" dim sum in Austin. both because I prefer my dim sum with no frills and because I hadn't found many great Asian places in the city. Street parking might not be the easiest but there's a parking garage for the building that Qi is located in. We were able to quickly get seating at the bar, which provides the best view of the steamers, woks, stock pots and chefs in action.

Crab meat corn soup: substantial lumps of crab, warm, comforting soup. Great with some of the chili oil that you can ask for on the side
Asian fried chicken: tender and juicy, seemed to be roasted rather than deep fried. Sauce of palm sugar and lime is addictive.
Pan sear basil chicken dumpling: never had Thai holy basil in a dumpling before, but it works. Thin wrapper and just lightly crispy.
Szechuan peppercorn alligator: battered pieces of alligator with some toasted chilies, peppercorn, and scallion. Similar in texture to chicken and good flavor, but definitely more suitable for sharing family style.
Truffle egg fried rice - in my opinion, a bit on the drier side though it's typical to use day-old rice. Yolk is mixed with each grain of rice to give a golden hue, and the yolk and earthy truffle flavor makes for a really fragrant bite. I think the truffle shaving on top could have been a bit thinner and maybe some scallions to garnish would have ben nice
Tingling daisy: probably the most unique cocktail I've had. You're supposed to take a nibble of the peppercorn flower in between sips for a little numbing sensation.

Overall, definitely a spot worth trying out in Austin when you're looking to splurge a little. Cozy and dim atmosphere with great food, would definitely return!","Food - Crab meat corn soup (substantial lumps of crab, warm and comforting), Asian fried chicken (tender and juicy, addictive sauce), Pan sear basil chicken dumpling (thin wrapper, lightly crispy, unique flavor), Szechuan peppercorn alligator (good flavor, more suitable for sharing), Truffle egg fried rice (fragrant, slightly dry, earthy flavor), Tingling daisy cocktail (unique, numbing sensation)||Parking - Garage available||Ambiance - Cozy and dim||Service - Great||Price - Worth splurging"
"Qi Austin is located at the very bottom of what seems to be a corporate office and you can definitely tell that people come here for lunch. I would highly recommend making a reservation because it fills up pretty quickly and that is the first thing they ask when walking in.

The service was pretty good and I was attended to frequently and the servers make sure to take your plate once you finish.

I went during lunch and ordered the

-Shanghai Soup Dumplings - The soup dumplings were very savory especially with the vinegar they provide. It came in 5, and we devoured it almost instantly.
-Shrimp Hargow - The shrimp hargow also came in 5. The quality of ingredients used were extraordinary. Again, it was devoured pretty quickly.
-Lunch Sesame Chicken - The lunch size is relatively small and is the perfect size in my opinion. The outer crust was super crispy paired with the sweet sauce made the dish very good.
-Lunch Akaushi Beef - The sauce is a little bit on the sour side, which didnt sit too well with me. However, the beef and vegetables itself were cooked to perfection and was super savory. I give the beef a 4.9/5.

All in all, I highly recommend Qis. It is on the pricer side for dim sum and their dim sum menu is relatively small, however their lunch specials more than make up for it.","Food - Shanghai Soup Dumplings (very savory, devoured quickly), Shrimp Hargow (extraordinary quality, devoured quickly), Lunch Sesame Chicken (super crispy, very good), Lunch Akaushi Beef (sour sauce, cooked to perfection, savory beef and vegetables)||Location - Bottom of corporate office, busy during lunch||Service - Attentive, frequent||Price - slightly high"
"Need date night ideas...come to Qi Austin!  Our table ordered a multitude of items.  Honestly couldn't tell you the name of some of them, but everything I tried was absolutely delicious! My favorite was the Sugarcane Shrimp, Truffle Fried Rice & Dumplings. I also learned there is a certain way to eat a dumpling.  1st time eating a dumpling. Shame on me. But now I know the proper way and will be back for more. The Zha Jiang Noodle was my least favorite.  It wasn't bad, but I just like noodles that have more sauce. If you come with a larger group it's a fun spot to share a few plates. Although I will say between two people the Half Peking Duck & Zha Jiang Noodle is more than enough. I'll be back for date night!","Food - Sugarcane Shrimp (favorite), Truffle Fried Rice (favorite), Dumplings (absolutely delicious, favorite), Zha Jiang Noodle (Not bad, prefer noodles with more sauce)"
"Qi's is an upscale dim sum and Chinese cuisine restaurant. Not only is the decor beautiful, but the food and service was good as well.

The interior of Qi's is nicely decorated with a mix of modern and traditional.

The service was phenomenal! The servers consistently checked up on us throughout the time and were very attentive, and after being seated, they pass out intricate designed plates and small bowls.

I ordered the Shanghai soup dumplings, shrimp hargow, vegetable steamed dumplings, pan akaushi beef potstickers,  sesame chicken, and the salt and pepper tofu.

Dim Sum:
The Shanghai soup dumplings tasted delicious and creamy with just the right amount of soup and were my favorite.  The shrimp hargow was plump and had a huge shrimp. The pan akaushi came nicely decorated. The steamed vegetable dumplings were my least favorite. They tasted very strong of something earthy and bitter. I do not recommend getting them.

Other Food:
The sesame chicken was good but tasted more generic. The salt and pepper tofu were pretty good, but I wish the outside were more crispy.

Overall, the ambiance is nice, and the food is good with superb service.","Food - Shanghai soup dumplings (delicious and creamy), shrimp hargow (plump with huge shrimp), pan akaushi beef potstickers (nicely decorated), sesame chicken (good but generic), salt and pepper tofu (pretty good, could be crispier)||Ambiance - Beautiful mix of modern and traditional décor||Service - Phenomenal, attentive"
"Me and my boyfriend came here for Friday night for date night and we had an amazing time!! We got the Shanghai soup dumplings, the caviar Shumai, pork belly, bok choy with shiitake mushrooms, and the spicy sesame chicken. We liked everything we got but our favorites were the shumai and the pork belly bc of how flavorful and juicy/tender they were!! They are known for their Shanghai soup dumplings but they were kinda eh to me just bc they tasted kinda frozen. We were so stuffed at the end and it was fun sharing everything family style. For drinks we got the lycheetini, watermelon cooler, and some sake all of them were so delicious! We made a reservation so we were seated right away and the service was really quick!!

"Amazing dim sum and great service! On the pricier side, but one of the best dim sum places I've been to all year.. Fresh ingredients, a dash of fusion, piping hot when it comes out, with more that I haven't tried yet.

Crab meat fish maw soup couplings - skin is on the thicker side, filling juicy and tender. Only complaint I have was that they didn't give me a soup spoon or extra bowls to eat this without spilling the juice.

Pork and shrimp sui mai - very fresh with good consistency.

Scallop caviar siu mai - amazingly good! 3 for $15 is a bit higher than the 5 for $12 normal siu mai, but flavor, texture (it was all mixed together, and not a normal siu mai with a scallop on top), juiciness exceeded my expectations. This siu mai was one of the best Ive had.

Scallion pancake curry dip - I like the concept and the strong onion flavor in the pancake, but I don't think the concept was executed very well. The pancake is on the smaller size and the curry is more liquid, so dipping it is very light, vs what you might get in a burmese paratha with coconut curry dip.

Crispy chicken turnover - They look like little mice, with the outsides having a mochi consistency and insides being on the salty savory side. Really well done and highly recommended!

Shrimp stuffed chinese eggplant - This was more of a shrimp on top of an eggplant.. Shrimp was very tender with good flavor. I liked the overall consistency of the dish, but would recommend giving it a min to cool down before starting.

Egg custard tart - very well executed with nice flavor, and extra flaky crust. It was more on the yellow side, and I personally would have preferred a little bit of a burn on the top.

The one dish I would not recommend is the stir fried potato glass noodle. For $19 its on the larger side, and its 100% carbs, so good value, but on the drier side and way too much to eat.","Food - Crab meat fish maw soup dumplings (thicker skin, juicy and tender filling), Pork and shrimp sui mai (very fresh, good consistency), Scallop caviar siu mai (amazingly good, exceeded expectations), Scallion pancake curry dip (concept liked, execution lacking), Crispy chicken turnover (well done, highly recommended), Shrimp stuffed Chinese eggplant (shrimp tender, good flavor), Egg custard tart (well executed, nice flavor, extra flaky crust), Stir fried potato glass noodle (on the drier side, too much to eat)||Service - Great||Price - high"
"Dinner in the city with my family...
We came for the dim sum...well no...I came for the dim sum and they came for the noodles.
I wasn't impressed with the food but the ambiance and service was impeccable. Idk...it's kinda hard judging Asian cuisine in the states when you're born and raised in Okinawa, so I don't want to be too picky.. but the main complaint was that all the noodle dishes we ordered was just too greasy. The food was fresh and had good flavors. cool place to catch up with friends for apps n drinks but no more big dinners here for us.

I didn't care for the passionfruit dessert at all.

I like the more elevated/upscale vibe though it didn't seem too busy on a weekend. The service was okay. Keep in mind, this isn't one of those places with the rolling cart (which I happen to love but that's okay).

"Delicious Dim Sum with great attention to detail and an inviting modern setting.

This is a great spot to enjoy dim sum that is mostly authentic, but also very approachable, whether for a date or a party.  The space is well appointed and comfortable -- with staff that are zippy, friendly, and welcoming.

The Dim Sum selection is very good, encompassing a large variety that will satisfy those seeking more authentic items and preparations.  It does not pander to cliches of Western expectations of Chinese food, but highlights Chinese cuisine in a manner that is generally authentic but also approachable with a high regard for detail.  Dim Sum staples are all really well executed -- from Shrimp Har Gow, Pork Shu Mai, to Egg Tarts (too many to name).  The rock stars of various types of buns including the soup dumpling are well executed.  Many typically traditional items such as Pea Shoots for a vegetable entree or Chicken Feet dim sum were cool to see as options.

A lot of what's on offer are interpretations that are up-leveled for concept, which they do very well.  The presentation of many items were very memorable, some admittedly were too aesthetically perfect to eat (specifically an item that was formed into the most adorable mice).  Finally, however, some items that are nice to see on the menu, deviate a bit too much from traditional expectations (specifically the Zar Zhang Noodles).

Overall a standout for Dim Dum and Chinese cuisine in Austin.  Excellent!","Food - Dim Sum (mostly authentic, large variety), Shrimp Har Gow (well-executed), Pork Shu Mai (well-executed), Egg Tarts (well-executed)||Ambiance - Modern, inviting||Service - Zippy, friendly, welcoming"
"Qi is my favorite place to get dim sum, or just fancy Chinese food, in general! Today, I had a big dinner with my mom and ordered:

o. steam lobster dumplings
o. scallop caviar sui mai dumplings
o. shrimp har gaw
o. crab meat corn soup
o. crispy whole fish
o. truffle egg fried rice

Of the three dumplings (and others that I've tried before), our favorite was the shrimp har gaw. Along with that, the crab meat corn soup is something we always order --and one bowl is definitely big enough of an appetizer to share between two people! Crispy whole fish and the truffle egg fried rice were two items that we ordered for the first time today, but both did not disappoint! The fish was lightly fried and covered in delicious sweet sauce, and was definitely big enough for 3+ people. The menu is at market price, and we paid $70, which I found to be pretty reasonable. Although both of us thought that the fish would go well with just a simple, white rice, the truffle egg fried rice was another great menu. It was super flavorful, and paired well with chili oil. They will definitely be a part of our staple items at Qi!","Food - Steam lobster dumplings (good), Scallop caviar sui mai dumplings (good), Shrimp har gaw (favorite), Crab meat corn soup (large portion), Crispy whole fish (lightly fried, delicious sweet sauce, large portion), Truffle egg fried rice (did not disappoint)||Price - Reasonable"
"What I love about this place, not only has a great ambience, cocktails, or solid, and food is flavorful. Please get the lychee martini, and watermelon, tequila cocktail, but replace it with Mezcal, it elevates the cocktail with the smokiness. Trust me.

Whether it's for date night, or a family meal, this place has the right flavors for you. Great appetizers with some soup dumplings, and wide selection of entrÃƒÂ©es (definitely recommend the truffle fried rice). The truffle fried rice is perfectly seasoned, fluffy, flavorful and just melts in your mouth. We came here last minute, sat at the bar and they were able to accommodate us within 15 minutes.

"The food here is amazing and well worth the price.

Arrived here on a Friday night at 6 pm. I could have made reservations prior but I didn't know if I would be craving dim sum at the time so decided to wing it.

Well I was, and me and my girlfriend were not disappointed with the food.

The Shanghai sound dumplings arrived with better presentation than I would expect for soup dumplings. The broth was rich and complimented the soft ground pork inside the dumpling.

I decided I was in AUSTIN TX and wanted to try something different, and got the alligator nuggets. It was like chicken but not tiring. Almost as if the fat was embedded into the fibers to keep it from becoming dry. My girlfriend didn't shut up about alligator tasting so good so that's how I knew the food had made the top of the list.

The truffle rice was amazing. I dont usually expect much from rice. It even Had a thinly sliced piece of truffle on top. My mouth watered. I didn't care for the noodles I ordered but what's a meal without noodles?  

I'm glad we took a chance and came here despite almost being turned away from a fully booked restaurant. When we arrived they looked at us crazy for not having reservations. We sat at the countertops watching the cooks make the dumplings. After an hour and ten minutes of eating, the restaurant was still half empty. Maybe confirm your reservations before immediately offering us the counters.  

The inside was nice, hell I even took photos of the bathroom because the toilet seat would automatically open.

Their Peking duck was also quite delicious; however, each order only came with 3 bao which is not enough for all the duck!

"For what it is, I think Qi is a decent Chinese restaurant in downtown Austin, and people should give it a try. Although not as good as other Asian restaurants in other states, they do have some unique and bold way of delivering their dim sum dishes.

The interior of the restaurant is beautiful: full of decor, especially the framed art! Did I forget to mention their bathroom has an automatic closing and opening lid? Lol I've digressed.

I would 100% recommend their hargow (shrimp dumplings). The texture is right for the flour, and the shrimp is nice and crunchy! The sticky rice is also good, and I've never seen it in a braided banana leaf like that. It's a little impractical and over the top, but at least it was aesthetically pleasing! The Peking duck is decent and affordable, and would give it a try if you've never had crispy duck skin before.

I would not recommend the xiaolongbao (soup dumplings). The dumpling was very mushy, and the filling was too sweet for my liking. I also did not like the egg bun. It was over cooked, and lacked the runny egg custard.","Food - Hargow (crunchy texture), Sticky rice (good), Peking duck (decent, affordable), Xiaolongbao (mushy, too sweet), Egg bun (overcooked, lacked runny egg custard)||Ambiance - Beautiful, full of decor, framed art"

Food- The menu is not as large as a casual dining Chinese restaurant (and this is upscale) but it has just about every protein normally found that you could want: beef, chicken, pork, duck, alligator and fish....tofu also. We've had most of the menu and it is all fantastic!
They also have an exceptionally good wine selection.

Our favorites is the pork soup dumplings. Served in all of Lin's restaurants and not to be missed.

The ambiance is warm, slightly dim and well appointed. There really isn't anything to not like about this place! It is definitely a favorite of ours!","Food - Pork soup dumplings (fantastic)||Service - Friendly, knowledgeable||Ambiance - Warm, well-appointed||Drinks - Good Wine selection"
"I can't believe I have not left a key review before now! this place is fantastic! First of all, they have a great list of dim sum that is offered all of the time. They are probably best known for their Shanghai soup dumplings and I concur! Although, everything we have tried on the dim sum menu has been noteworthy. The weekend dim sum brunch menu is off the charts!!

The entrÃƒÂ©e menu, is not excessively long like many Asian restaurants, yet has every kind of protein that you can want, as well as some vegetarian options. Duck, pork, lobster, crab, shrimp, Akaushi beef, chicken, fish....see my point?!

Dessert is also incredible and dessert is not my thing. Too many to list but there is something that will grab you.

Oh, I almost forgot one of the best parts! They usually have a featured bottle of wine, that is a really good bottle, for up to 50% off on occasion. Last week, it was just 30% off but it was absolutely worth it. They have my favorite wine list of all Asian restaurants in Austin.

AND they have free parking in the attached garage! In downtown Austin! What??!!

If you enjoy Asian food of the Chinese variety, you must try this place!","Food - Shanghai soup dumplings (fantastic), dim sum menu (noteworthy), weekend dim sum brunch (off the charts), entrée menu (has every kind of protein, some vegetarian options), dessert (incredible)||Drinks - featured bottle of wine (really good, up to 50% off), wine list (favorite of all Asian restaurants)||Parking - Free in attached garage"
"I came here mostly for the dining experience and to bond with friends. It's situated in a nice spot on West 6th, and the free garage parking is a HUGE perk being in that area. No need to circle the blocks 20x looking for street parking!

The food is pretty decent & flavorful, however, as a Chinese person who tends to frequent dim sum restaurants in Chinatown Houston when craving such, I knew the restaurant was catering to a specific crowd when setting it's price point/serving portions.

Our server, the cocktails, and the ambience were great though! But I probably would not come here if I was straight up craving dim sum, and only dim sum, when I could find it for the fraction of a price at a hole-in-the-wall (authentic) spot somewhere.",Food - Decent & flavorful||Location - nice||Parking - free||Ambiance - Great||Service - great||Price - high
"On a quick trip to Austin, this place was lively on a Sunday night. For a group of 3 at 7:30pm, we were sat immediately at a table outside under some fan/misting.

Food was delicious:
- the Shanghai soup dumplings were hot and unique in that the filling was soft and homogenous rather than a lump of meat sitting in a pool of liquid
- Zha Jiang noodles were a touch spicy that made it flavorful and tasty
- Honey Akaushi Beef was delicious with great soft texture and crunchy fresh onions in a sweet glaze
- Baby Bok Choi was fresh and crunchy with yummy shiitake mushrooms and came beautifully presented

The ambiance was classy with thoughtful touches and nods to Asian culture around. The outdoor patio was on a relatively busy street, but didn't diminish the ambiance much.

Service was prompt and friendly, and food came out quickly!

Our only gripe was the price tag. While the food was delicious, we weren't sure that the few pieces of beef garnered a $29 tag, nor the XLB/soup dumplings $3 each. Understandably, it's presenting itself as finer dining in an expensive-to-rent area, so we definitely think it's worth trying if you're willing to splurge!","Food - Shanghai soup dumplings (hot and unique, filling was soft ad homogeneous), Zha Jiang noodles (spicy, flavorful and tasty), Honey Akaushi Beef (delicious, soft texture), and fresh Baby Bok Choi (fresh and crunchy, beautifully presented)||Ambiance - Classy with thoughtful Asian cultural touches||Service - Friendly and prompt||Price - high"
"Incredible experience. Hands down best Shanghai Soup Dumplings I've ever had. Everything about their flavor and texture and broth was addictive. I'd love to try the crabmeat ones as well next time. We also had the pan fried beef bao, which had an amazingly soft bun with a light and perfect crisp to the outside. We ordered the crispy pecan shrimp entre, which was also delicious, although I wish we'd had more people to split it with since it was gluttonous to eat so much sweet fried stuff. We finished off with the chocolate filled bao, which was tasty although next time I'll use my stomach space on more soup dumplings

Our waiter was super friendly and welcoming, and the overall atmosphere was great. Can't wait to come back for more dumplings and try new things on the menu!","Food - Shanghai Soup Dumplings(addictive flavor, texture and broth), Pan Fried Beef Bao(amazingly soft bun, light and perfect crisp to the outside), Crispy Pecan Shrimp (delicious but gluttonous), Chocolate Filled Bao (tasty)||Service - Super friendly and welcoming||Ambiance - Great"

"I didn't realize how fancy this place would be until I walked in. The waiter was super nice and the decor was fun. We ordered a few dim sum items and then the crispy seafood noodle dish.

Will definitely come back when I'm in town!","Food - Dim Sum (Delicious), Crispy seafood noodle dish (Delicious), matcha dessert (not too sweet, not too much)||Service - Super nice waiter||Ambiance - fun"
"By no means is a three-star review a negative. If someone wanted to come eat here, I wouldn't deter them. It's just that Qi is not for me. Qi fills a specific niche (elevated Asian-inspired) which I don't often crave.

Overall, the food here was fine but I probably wouldn't choose to come back since parking isn't ""easy"" and the meal wasn't really worth the price (to me). On the plus side, the ambiance was great, drink options were unique, and the menu offered some fun and diverse options. I'm glad to see them have success but it's just not for me. I'll stick to enjoying their dim sum items at Lin since the best part of their dinner menu was the XLB.",Food - Fine||Ambiance - Great||Drinks - unique||Menu - diverse and fun||Parking - Not easy||Price - high
"The inside of the restaurant is very trendy and aesthetically pleasing. Parking is relatively easy, there is a parking garage behind the restaurant.

Food was okay not the best I've had. The soup dumpling was dry and meat was crumbly. The lobster was over cooked and chewy. Overall the food is salty.

I personally would not come back. The food is expensive and not good.","Food - Soup dupling (dry and crumbly), Lobster (overcooked and chewy)||Ambiance - trendy and aesthetically pleasing||Parking - Easy||Price - high"

The place itself is clean and cozy with a good amount of seating. This is a must-try if you are seeking delicious Asian cuisine.","Food - Yummy, authentic||Price - reasonable||Ambiance - Clean and cozy"
This place was amazing!!! The food is incredible and extremely flavorful. I took my family here while they were in town visiting. We were able to get a walk in but it was very busy so I would highly recommend making a reservation if possible. They are famous for their soup dumplings and they were so good we ordered a second round of them. Our server was fabulous and knowledgeable to give delicious recommendations. I certainly will be coming back soon!,Food - Soup Dumplings (good)||Service - Fabulous and knowledgeable
"I've been eyeing Qi for quite some time now, and finally had the opportunity to celebrate my one year anniversary with my husband on 10/16/22.

Ambience - Great atmosphere with Asian decor, and wine cellars throughout the restaurant.  The restaurant is on the smaller side, however they also have outdoor seating too.  Nonetheless, it's the perfect place for date night, girls night out, dinner with family, etc.

Service - As soon as we entered the restaurant we were greeted and seated immediately which was great!  I didn't get the name of our waitress, but she was great to work with and super friendly. She made a few recommendations on the food, suggested a red blend wine which we loved and gave us complimentary dessert for our anniversary as well.  She also checked up on us frequently which I really appreciated.

Food - everything we ordered was fantastic!  We ordered:

Crab Meat Fish Soup Dumplings
Lobster Dumplings
Truffle Egg Fried Rice
Shrimp Stuffed Eggplant
Shrimp Har Kaw
Pork & Shrimp Shu mai
Cilantro Shrimp Dumpling
Fried Snapper with Sweet & Sour sauce

I also wanted to note their 3 dipping sauces for the dim sum, their chili sauce was my favorite!  It has a bit of sweetness to it which I loved!

Pricing - A bit on the higher end, but for the quality of the food, it's well worth paying.  

Parking - Free garage parking.  Just be on the lookout for signage as some of the spots are reserved

Qi Austin is definitely 5 stars for me.  Looking forward to my next visit.","Ambiance - Great atmosphere||Service - super friendly||Food - Crab Meat Fish Soup Dumplings (fantastic), Lobster Dumplings (fantastic), Truffle Egg Fried Rice (fantastic), Shrimp Stuffed Eggplant (fantastic), Shrimp Har Kaw (fantastic), Pork & Shrimp Shu mai (fantastic), Cilantro Shrimp Dumpling (fantastic), Fried Snapper with Sweet & Sour sauce (fantastic)||Price - high||Parking - Free"
"I recently had the opportunity to dine at Qi, and it turned out to be a pleasant culinary experience. While it might not have been a mind-blowing revelation, there were certainly aspects of the meal that left a positive impression.

Qi's ambiance is comfortable and inviting. The restaurant's interior is tastefully decorated with subtle Chinese motifs, creating a relaxed and cozy atmosphere. It's an ideal spot for a casual dinner with friends or family.

Now, onto the food. Qi offers a broad range of classic Chinese dishes, and the menu has something to suit various tastes. The highlights for me included the General Tso's Chicken, which had a nice balance of sweet and savory flavors, and the vegetable dumplings, which were delightfully fresh and accompanied by a tasty dipping sauce. The hot and sour soup was another winner, with a satisfying blend of tanginess and spiciness.","Ambiance - Comfortable and inviting, tastefully decorated interior||Food - General Tso's Chicken (nice balance of sweet and savory flavors), Vegetable Dumplings (fresh with tasty dipping sauce), Hot and Sour Soup (satisfying blend of tanginess and spiciness)"
"Great ambiance and nice murals. Food is just average, a little overpriced. Our servers were pretty attentive. My favorite dish was the hot & sour soup. And my least favorite one was the truffle egg fried rice - very plain, would not recommend. I tried to be a little adventurous and ordered the crocodile but it was a little disappointing. Overall a restaurant with good vibe and 7/10 Chinese food.","Ambiance - Great, nice murals||Food - Hot & Sour Soup (favorite), Truffle Egg Fried Rice (very plain, would not recommend), Crocodile (disappointing)||Price - high||Service - attentive"
"Found out about this place from a story on someone's IG. Thought the food presentation and decor looked really good, but that's all it is. Looks. Service wasn't the best. Our server wasn't personable, he actually seemed miserable being there. He took long and didn't really talk unless he had to.

Food presentation was nice and it sounded good on the menu.  Lobster dumpling, scallop caviar siu mai, it sounds good right? No, it wasn't good. It was terrible! I felt so bad because it was my idea to go there and the food is kind of pricey. I couldn't finish the food, I didn't enjoy it at all. The only food I decently liked was the egg drop soup and fried rice. But how can you mess those two foods up. I guess it's a place to try if you want to see the pretty decor and take some foodie pics, but that's it. I have no interest coming back.","Ambiance - Good decort||Food - Lobster Dumpling (terrible), Scallop Caviar Siu Mai (terrible), Egg Drop Soup (decent), Fried Rice (decent)||Service - not personable, is miserable, didn't talk"
"Oh, this place rocks!! The dim sum is excellent, high quality and very nicely done. Some of the items are slightly fusion and adapted to this area and culture, but the quality and the workmanship put into the dim sum with spectacular presentation is well worth the extra cost. I'm from the San Francisco area and I am Asian so I know good dim sum.

All the ingredients are so fresh and they use locally sourced produce from a local farm when possible. We went there for dinner and it was so good and we were so impressed that we came back the next morning for dim sum! For dinner we had the bok choy with shiitake mushrooms, excellent with a subtle sauce on it. We also had the seafood curry which was chock-full of different types of seafood in it, they were very generous. Between dinner in the evening and dim sum the next morning, we had many of their dishes but I will just comment on some of the stand outs. For dim sum, their shrimp stuffed Chinese eggplant was so plump and delicious. Their crispy chicken turnovers were shaped like cute little mice, so fun to eat and delicious too! The salt and pepper shrimp was excellent, nice subtle flavors. Their cilantro shrimp dumplings and basil chicken dumplings were so satisfying and flavorful. We loved the Shanghai soup dumplings, round and plump with hearty broth inside. Their desserts are amazing and excellent, be sure to try one!

The service is immaculate, friendly and helpful and very efficient. The manager is a very good manager.  One thing fun about the place is that they have automatic toilets with motion sensors.

"Qi Austin (pronounced Chi) owned by Lin is the spot to go to in Austin. It's tough to get reservations because everyone wants to go, and I see why! The food is great!! You have to get dumplings. I ordered the crab meat soup dumplings and Akaushi Beef with Green Pepper. Such a great restaurant. Can't wait to go back!","Food - Crab Meat Soup Dumplings (great), Akaushi Beef with Green Pepper (great)"
"There are very few Asian restaurants in Austin that has the authentic feel, taste and charm making you feel as if you are actually dining in another country like Qi. The decor is very contemporary, but still made you feel as if you were walking the streets of Shanghai. I am a huge fan of Lin's dim sum and now, I can add Qi to my list. We started with the Shanghai soup dumplings, lobster dumplings and chicken taro egg rolls.
The special of the evening was a salt and pepper whole lobster, but we were disappointed to find out that at 7:30 in the evening, they were completely out! However, we were soon relieved when we were told that they still had the salt and pepper lobster tails available. We ordered those in addition to the honey beef and the truffle egg fried rice. We enjoyed all of our dishes, several bottles of sake, as well as the service we received from Kriselda.","Ambiance - great decor||Food - Shanghai Soup Dumplings (enjoyed), Lobster Dumplings (enjoyed), Chicken Taro Egg Rolls (enjoyed), Salt and Pepper Lobster Tails (enjoyed), Honey Beef and Truffle Egg Fried Rice (enjoyed)||Service - Impressive"
"After trying Lin, we had to try the sister restaurant Qi. Located near Whole Foods downtown and not to far from Lin. They have their own garage so parking was easy.

We decided to try our luck again and did a walk-in. Would definitely recommend you make reservations though. After a small wait we were seated at the bar.  The place had beauty decorations everywhere from lanterns and umbrellas to robes and glass sculptures.  One thing that stood out to me was the signed bottle of wine near the front of the entrance. Pro Football Hall of Famer Tony Gonzalez!

Our Baristas were Minh and ""Rabbit"". Not sure if they were just playing with us since it's the year of the Rabbit/Cat, but it was funny. They had a special Lunar new year drink menu. Tried both the Red Envelope and the Jade Rabbit. Both were beautiful and delicious and had gold flakes. We also tried a couple normal menu drinks Watermelon Cooler and Honey Cider. Both were very refreshing.

For appetizers we ordered the Crab Meat Corn Soup and Scallop Caviar Sui Mai Dumplings. The soup rich and the Crab delicious. The dumplings were delightful. They looked so good, I didn't give them a little time to cool before gobbling them up.

Both our entrees were beef protein. The Honey Akaushi Beef and Rainbow Akaushi Beef were cooked beautifully. They both had a nice crispy sear on the beef and flavorful sauce.

After trying Lin, Qi did not disappoint. Fun servers and delicious food is always a great combination. Two thumbs up!","Ambiance - Beautiful decor||Drinks - Red Envelope (beautiful, delicious), Jade Rabbit(beautiful, delicious), Watermelon cooler (refreshing), Honey Cider (refreshing)||Food - Crab Meat Corn Soup (rich, delicious), Scallop Caviar Sui Mai Dumplings (delightful), Honey Akaushi Beef (crispy, flavorful sauce), Rainbow Akaushi Beef (crispy, flavorful sauce)||Parking - easy||Service - Fun"
"Qi is one of my all time favorite restaurants in Austin! The best way to describe is exquisite dim sum and chinese cuisine. As a sister restaurant to Lin's, Qi has the famous soup dumplings that in my opinion make this place worth visiting.

I have not yet encountered any other establishment that has great soup dumplings that are comparable to Qi/Lin's. Other items that I liked to get at the scallop caviar Sui mai, honey sesame chicken, and occasionally the har gow.

If you are used to normal traditional Chinese dim sum establishments, do NOT expect the same experience here. Expect to pay higher prices and receive good service. If you are looking for a large variety of dim sum items, I would look elsewhere in Austin. During lunch and dinner, the dim sum menu is not as expansive.

I would say this makes for a great spot to meet with friends or go on a date. I'm hoping they will open a restaurant in Houston!","Food - dim sum (exquisite), soup dumplings (great), scallop caviar Sui mai (liked), honey sesame chicken (liked), har gow (liked),||Service - good||Price - high"
"The best dimsum in Austin hands down. The atmosphere reminds of of some famous dumsum places in SF. Everything tasted authentic and there was plenty of options to pick from. They add a little special touch to each traditional dimsum item, whether it be presentation or extra ingredients. I honestly think you can order just about anything here and be satisfied. The only thing I would avoid is the zhajianmein. The thing I would recommend the most is the deserts if you love matcha.

"Came here for my daughters birthday last night. We get to our table and the waiter is on us immediately. We need a sec so he comes back again in about a minute. My wife orders a drink off their drinks menu, I order a captain & coke, daughter orders a Shirley temple. My wife's drink and the Shirley temple show up, we put in our order. No drink for me. 10 minutes later still no drink for me. So I get his attention and he comes over and before I can say where's my drink he says ""oh we don't have captain Morgan.""... like 10 minutes went by and he didn't bother to tell me they couldn't make my drink...so I order a Bacardi and coke. This time it only took a few minutes for him to say they didn't have Bacardi.  At this point I'm annoyed so I make do with water for the night.

The food. Generally pretty good. The soup dumplings were just ""ok.""  Not much there flavor wise. The beef dumplings were also just ok. But the shrimp dumplings (har gow?) were fantastic, as was the duck. Fried rice and sesame chicken were fine.

So, back to all the fun we had with the waiter. Now that's it's busier he's nowhere to be found. Woulda been great to have some of that food with some water...

So after dinner we mention that it's my daughters birthday. He brings out some ice cream and a candle which is great.

We get the bill, and to my disbelief he's charged for BOTH drinks that I didn't get, and also for the desert that we didn't order. Fortunately there was no argument about taking the drinks and desert off the bill.

So I guess the moral of this story is only order drinks off their drink menu, and check your bill.

Oh, they also forgot the baby bok choy we ordered (didn't even make its way into the bill).","Food - soup dumplings (ok), beef dumplings (ok), shrimp dumplings (fantastic), duck (fantastic), fried rice (fine), sesame chicken (fine)||Service - missing drinks, forgot orders||Ambiance - cool ambiance and atmosphere||Price - high"

I would say the actual food is pretty mediocre and you're better off finding a local run restaurant that's more affordable instead. I got the spicy chicken and while it was good...there was nothing remarkable about it. It was my birthday and they brought out a little cat shaped passion fruit ice cream dessert so I did appreciate that. Again a great experience, but you can find more affordable options with better food elsewhere.","Food - pretty mediocre, spicy chicken (nothing remarkable)||Service - nice||Ambiance - cool||Price - high"

"Qi is Lin's sister that is just a bit closer to down with a better parking situation. We walked in on a busy weekend, grabbed a drink, and waited with fingers crossed that we would get a seat at the well appointed bar. Success! (I definitely recommend making resos.)
We tried all of the Lunar New Year special cocktails. They were beautifully crafted and served by witty and cheerful bartenders. The wine list is impressive!
But the true stars lie on the pages of the food menu.
We started with crab corn soup. It was somehow both light and hardy. The velvety broth was dotted with ample protein, yet the corn was perfectly highlighted.
Next came the scallop caviar shu mai. What a treat. We could not resist the aroma and gobbled the steamy sea pillows. We could have stopped there, but the beef dishes called out. Both the pepper beef and honey beef were beautifully seasoned and seared. The honey beef was a bit overly honeyed for me. Also, I asked to make it spicy, but it was not. It was still delicious, but I preferred the pepper beef.

All in all, Qi is a must when looking for passionately chef-driven Asian cuisine in Austin. But once you eat at Lin, I just don't know if I can give another restaurant 5 stars! If I could give 4.9 though, I would!","Food - crab corn soup (light and hardy, velvety broth, dotted with ample protein, perfectly highlighted corn), scallop caviar shu mai (treat), pepper beef (beautifully seasoned and seared), honey beef (beautifully seasoned and seared, bit overly honeyed)||Drinks - Lunar New Year special cocktails||Service - witty and cheerful bartenders"

"Fusion restaurant located in the west downtown area.

Those of you craving traditional dim sum, you are about to be disappointed if that's your expectation. The menu is a creative fusion between American and pan-Asian--predominantly Chinese--dishes. If one were to rate this place based on its representation of more traditional dim sum, it would probably get only 2 stars.

Alright! Now that we got that controversy out of the way, judging this establishment based purely on the quality of the food it serves, the experience, and the value, I'd give it 4 stars. Each of the dishes I've had here have generally been quite good, with nothing that stood out as anything altogether bad. If you have a xiao long bao craving, this place will work for you in a pinch. I feel guilty saying this, but one of my favorite dishes here in the past was the gator with Sichuan seasoning (see, I told you this was a fusion restaurant). This dish has a nice amount of numbing spice to it, and I can imagine that some people who aren't used to consuming numbing spice probably wouldn't be a fan (but I personally am). The cocktails here are also pretty solid and worth trying as well.","Food - gator with Sichuan seasoning (liked, numbing spice), dim sum (Asian-American fusion, not traditional)||Drinks - solid cocktails"
