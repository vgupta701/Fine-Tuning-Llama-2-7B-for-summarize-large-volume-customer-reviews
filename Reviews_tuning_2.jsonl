We had reservations for a table of 4. We were seated right away.\n\nOur server greeted us promptly and had our drinks placed immediately. I tried the dragon fruit refresher and it was absolutely delicious!!\n\nWe split the appetizer for the table. I enjoyed the pork bun and the satays. The fresh spring roll, I would recommend, eating first because the wrap ends up sticking to the banana leaves and tears the longer you let them sit. I wish it was served with a peanut butter sauce, but it wasn't a deal breaker.\n\nI ordered the green curry with filet mignon. Comes with steamed rice. The dish is so rich, but all I could taste was the smokiness of the steak. It overpowered the sweet curry. I liked that it had plenty of veggies and the steak was cut in bite sized pieces. It is on the spicier side, fair warning. You also can't adjust the spice level.\n\nI tried my friend's crispy pad Thai, which was absolutely delicious. The sauce is rich and you can really get the lime flavor. It is pretty spicy though. I don't know if I'd be able to eat the whole dish, but it's yummy.\n\nTo get the spice out of my mouth, I ordered the Ube pana cotta. Oh my goodness!! This is such a stellar dessert!!! Ube was perfect. Not too sweet and the panna cotta was divine!!! I would go again just for this dessert.

I'm not a huge fan of duck but with so many reviews on this dish, I had to give it a try and it was honestly delicious. Wasn't \"duck\" tasting at all! The calamari was also good and exactly what you would expect but I would have preferred a bigger portion for the price.\nWe then ordered the chicken pad Thai, seafood fried rice served in a coconut and the red curry with chicken. All 3 entrees were absolutely delicious with the perfect amount of heat for me without asking for any adjustments.\nI would order the exact same meal again if I had to but ofcourse next time I'll want to try some of their other dishes as I'm sure they'll be as good!\nLastly, service was excellent.

We made a reservation a few weeks out. It's beautiful inside, and our server was extremely friendly and helpful.\n\nMy one gripe is that they don't offer any modifications to the majority of their dishes - I totally understand from a chef perspective, but as someone with dietary restrictions (and a low spice tolerance!!) it made it difficult because we couldn't order a few of the things we initially wanted to and had to pivot.\n\nWe split the house fried rice. It was delicious, but we were really hoping to try the more exciting pineapple or coconut ones - neither of which could have the spiciness removed so we opted out. I liked that we could get a combo of chicken, shrimp, and beef. We both agreed that the beef was our favorite.\n\nI got the duck skewers, which were AMAZING. I just wish they were bigger!!! The dipping sauce they came with was perfect too. So tender and flavorful.\n\nMy friend ordered steamed dumplings. They were rainbow colored, and I'm not sure how they make them colorful so it kind of freaked me out a bit since I try not to consume artificial coloring, etc. I did try one and felt it was too chewy for my liking - I probably would have preferred them fried.

We used to love coming here, definitely one of our favorites and recommended it to so many. The special memories we have made here will last forever. However, now when I pass the restaurant I get a little queasy, a little sad, and not mad... but definitely dissappointed.\n\nThe last time we visited here, we brought a guest with us and we had a fantastic meal. However, all three of us became very ill within the next 24 hours. 100% food poisoning. It hit me the worst, because I was pregnant on top of it and ended up in the emergency room all night. Thankfully our guest didn't have it hit her until her plane landed back in her home state. I felt awful for taking her somewhere that ended up making us all sick, although I know anything can happen anywhere and it isn't necessarily a reflection of the establishment. We have never had an issue there any other time.\n\nThe problem was their reaction to this when we called them to let them know that others might be I'll as well and we wanted to give them a run down of what we ate so they could figure out what it was. The original person we spoke with was more than apologetic and ready to help but whoever he gave the information to, was not. They quite literally tried to blame us and say it was probably food allergies. Yes, all three of us suddenly have a good allergy we never knew about and all of us have the same one with the same reaction and it only hit us after eating at your restaurant. We had to stay extremely persistent to get any kind of help in the situation.\n\nI miss their great food and violin events, but haven't been able to get myself to go back after their reaction to such a disappointing experience.

Well my husband finally took me for a nice dinner and my oh my were our mouths and bellies thankful for the experience! And \"experience\" is the only way to describe this! Our first visit, our server was amazing and so helpful with recommendations- she actually convinced me to order something completely different just by her passion for this specific dish. We started the with soup dumplings and actually had no idea how to eat them - but you can find anything on YouTube these days right? I'm being 1000% serious, I totally searched in on YouTube so we could properly eat these dumplings. When I say I could quite literally just order multiple orders of the dumplings and eat them as my appetizer, meal, and dessert.... I mean it. The calamari was  seasoned to perfection and so satisfying. I'm fairly certain I got a box for two pieces of calamari. That's just silly to you if you haven't had it before... but once you have it, you, too, will not let it go to waste. The dipping sauce was the perfect match. For dinner, I got the Filet Green Curry and WOW , this was just the right dish for me, not too spicy, enough to save for second meal the next day (which was gold) - and very flavorful! My husband was the winner here, he got the Pho Rib (served with a filet) and DAMMMMNNNNN GINA! The presentation, the taste, the impending doom we both felt as the dish came near its end- because that flavor deserves to be tasted forever.  This dish was the star for sure!\n\nWe went back again on Christmas Eve for an incredible evening with Omar Phoenix playing the violin and we sat and ate and drank and melted in the presence of this incredible artist for four hours. I could write about that night alone forever but then I might need a publisher and a pen name. Magical. This place is absolutely magical.\n\nPro tips: the old fashioned is $18 but it's prepared tableside in a smoker and it's a whole thing! We enjoyed them. The five sampler: totally worth it. Eat the soup dumplings and watch youtube to do it properly. Your server can be amazing or mediocre but the food will always satisfy. If Omar is playing, make reservations, bring your friends, and go! Someone at your table MUST order the Pho Rib. That is a non negotiable.

Also I will add that sometimes the mushrooms look like the chicken / it was hard for me to distinguish so I wouldn't count on being able to pick them out!\n\nI have never actually eaten at the Restaurant, but it looks nice!

Wait time to get a seat was a bit long, but plenty of space outside to wait.\n\nCame here for my dad's belated birthday and he was able to get a dessert which was this decadent taro flan.  But first started off the meal with the spicy Saigon chicken wings. They had a real nice crispy skin and right amount of fire. Then had duck four season which was served with lychee and longan for that sweet and savory taste. No bao buns like your usual Peking duck dishes. But the duck was cooked nicely and still really moist. We got the salted pepper shrimp, pineapple fried rice, and oxtail pho since my dad really wanted to try the oxtail. He was thoroughly impressed even though he knows how to make his own pho at home. The meat falls off the bone and the broth tasted rich yet clean.

Emily served us and made great recommendations, this review would be all about her if I kept talking about her.\n\nIn my very own opinion I'd say that the food was average, good but average, and the service/nature of the restaurant made it 4 stars.\n\nI ordered Calamari and Orange Chicken. Calamari was great, orange chicken was good. The rice was SO bland. I mean I get it, it's just white rice, but I've had better. The chicken, for me, could have been a TAD more crispy but I'm just being picky. It's probably the best portion of chicken I've had whenever ordering orange chicken. It wasn't over powered by breading.\n\nMy friend ordered salmon and said it was a great portion size and very tasty he left very full and satisfied.\n\nThe only true negative I'll mention is there were a decent amount of flies. When we first arrived there weren't that many. I think as more people arrived towards the end of our meal flies just kept flying in. Not sure if this is something they can truly control. But it was bothersome.\n\nOverall 1618 is worth a second visit and for a different meal. I'll definitely have the calamari again though.

From planning it with the event planner via email to being helped by the hostess and staff.\n\nWhen my group got there, we was immediately greeted by the front staff. Told them I have been communicating with the event planner to have the semi private room reserved for 17 guest. The hostess asked if we wanted the private room\nBecause they spoke to the manager. I said yes of course if it's available.\n\nI know serving 17 guest at a table will be hard but kudos to our waitress, she was amazing! Very professional and was very attentive. Im so glad I chose this place for breakfast.\n\nFOOD : their pho broth is so good... It's both rich and clean. They use the flat pho noodles you see in Vietnam (more traditional) compare to the thin ones you see at other places. Most at the table got the Pho Beef Rib with filet mignon. For $22? Such a steal. I do wish that they gave more pho noodles... But overall, it's one of the best pho I ever had. We ordered so many apps from Shu Mai to crispy shrimp balls, so excited I forgot to take pictures!\n\nDRINKS : we tried the Smokey old fashioned. For $20? It was ok. I can't complain because usually Old Fashioned go for $20. I didn't really taste the Smokey ness..\n\nOverall, if I'm In the area, I would definitely come back. Highly recommend it!

The place itself feels kind of tucked away, yet you wander in upon this oasis.\n\nThe space itself is open and filled with live plants everywhere and beautiful decor. The staff was extremely attentive, friendly, and provided great suggestions around popular dishes or their personal favorites. We had Eric and he was phenomenal!\n\nFor the meal we ordered the chicken dumplings, yellow curry, pad Thai, and the appetizer assortment bc who doesn't love apps! I can't even describe the flavors, the curry was some of the best curry I've had hands down. The app platter was 100% the way to go, lots of food, not too expensive, and you get to try one or two of each item!\n\nI will be back and will be bringing family friends you name it, this place is a gem in Austin.

On the other hand, duck red curry was as legit as it can taste. Been jumping to different asian restaurants and we can say this is one of our top asian restaurants.\n\nWe really enjoyed the place from the food, service, and the ambiance.

The decor is very modern and the servers are very helpful and friendly.\nFamily decided to start with the five sampler and we were amazed. Everything, I repeat everything was delicious! From the skewers that had a very different sauce to the spring rolls, which we usually are not fans as we had never found one that has real taste, but this one is really good.\nFor mains, the family decided to go with the pad Thai and the duck fried rice. The duck was perfectly cooked with crispy skin and tender meat. It was also well seasoned. For the pad Thai, the server mentioned that the spice level was a 2 out of 5, but we'd say it was a 3. If you're not very familiar with spicy flavor what h out for this one. Portions are big and presentation is very good.\nMy daughter also ordered the cafe and she liked it.\nA big bonus: this place is pet friendly! Seeing some dogs in the main dining room brought a huge smile to my face! Kiddos to the owners.

I'd ordered some 1618 via ubereats, and when that went well (but not before showing up unannounced to discover this spot already had enough street cred to generate a sizeable wait time), we called ahead and found free spots at the bar one night to have our maiden in-person experience here!  \n\nFrom the dÃƒÂ©cor to the hospitality, the mood was set. Loved the interesting lines of the interior design and the wine room in the midst of the dining room! There's even a stay for... live music and other acts?! Yesss!\n\nAnd on to the food. Since we'd had to wait a hot minute, we decided to share a smattering of options. And when I say this place has food on par with Lin Dim Sum and Julie's Noodles, I MEAN IT!\n\nThe scallion pancakes are instantly (and maybe permanently) my favorite of anywhere I've had them. Usually super-thin and crispy and far from substantial, the scallion pancakes here were pillowy-soft, dimensional, and oh so divine!  Will ALWAYS get more in the future! -- 14/10\n\nThe pork, shrimp & shiitake Sui Mai (3-pc order) were ample and well filled, but I've just never been big on this flavor combo, though I'd still say they were \"pretty good\" -- 8/10\n\nNow dem Xiao Long Bao (5-pc order)... holy pork soup dumplings on a spoon...!  I'd say on par IF NOT BETTER THAN Lin/ Julie's. Bigger bite for sure, and I think I could easily take down a few orders solo!  Definitely contenders here, and they've got these on the Dim sum brunch menu for a STEAL at $11! -- 14/10\n\nThe clay pot sticky rice I was \"meh\" about, I think mainly because I'm not big on Chinese sausage... but my honey liked it quite a lot!  -- 7/10 (for me)\n\nMango sticky rice was served beautifully, but I didn't love it. I dunno why... I'll try it once more before I even rate it..  maybe it just failed to be amazing following one of the best desserts of my life--\n\nThe Flambeau Everest cheesecake, fired with vanilla honey liqueur, cinnamon is sprinkled over it as the flames engulf the plate & topped with a scoop of coconut pineapple ice cream...... OK I need to go get another one soon after describing it alone!  I am a cheesecake aficionado, and this one absolutely, unequivocally takes the LITERAL cake!  What a whirlwind of unexpectedly epic deliciousness on a spoon!  -- 15/10\n\nSeriously.\nDeliriously.\nDivine! [/INST] Ambiance - Interesting interior design, live music||Food - Scallion pancakes (favorite), pork, shrimp & shiitake Sui Mai (ample, well filled), Xiao Long Bao (delicious), Sticky rice (meh), Mango sticky rice (beautifully presented, didn't like), Flambeau Everest cheesecake (delicious)||Service - Great </s>"}

The live music was amazing and created an amazing vibe for the restaurant. It is such a homey yet up-scale place that was beautiful.\n\nWe ordered calamari and grilled octopus. The batter for the calamari is soooo good and the salt,pepper,lemon dip adds the best type of flavor. The grilled octopus was on a stick and had a good Smokey flavor. Both great. We also ordered the papaya salad with shrimp. It was very refreshing and crunchy with the fish sauce smell but not super overpowering fish sauce taste. Very good!\n\nFor mains we got the L redfish and duck fried rice. So so so good. Only thing is I wish the tables were a little bigger since their food is a lot of family style options. But the food was amazing. The redfish belly was so so caramelized and crispy. I will now always crave this. The fried rice was good flavor. Very authentic since I'm very picky about fried rice. I was able to take both's leftovers to go and it was just as good the next day. We also got some stir fry which has good flavor and came with white rice.\n\nWe ended with the flaming cheesecake. Our server did it table side and it was an entertainment in itself. Very good and light.\n\nOur server was great as all. Very attentive. The place is pretty busy so he was always running around, but overall he was able to answer all our questions and keep us satisfied for dinner.\n\nHighly recommend this place [/INST] Food - Calamari (delicious batter), Grilled octopus (good smokey flavor), Papaya salad (refreshing), L Redfish (caramelized, crispy), duck fried rice (amazing), stir fry (good flavor), flaming cheesecake (very good, light)||Ambiance - Homey yet upscale, live music, great vibe||Service - Great, attentive </s>"}

Nobody needs or wants to hear a violin at 1000 decibels as they try to have dinner on a Thursday night in an Asian restaurant. It's piercing, it's annoying. Even worse it's so off tune. The severs are yelling at you. The music is way over amplified. If I wanted to go see a concert I'd be at a concert.

This is not your mom's Vietnamese pho, and that's a good thing.  Some purists may not like the elevated twists, but to me 1618 is worth a visit.\n\nMy Overall Rating - 4 Stars (Atmosphere, Service, Food, Return)\n\nAtmosphere - On the outside, 1618 Asian Fusion is as unassuming as it's name.  But inside it's a large, open space.  There's a desk dedicated to To Go orders (expertly packaged), and a stage that features live entertainment.  We were treated to a fantastic acoustic set which really accentuated the cool vibe.  1 Star.\n\nService - Our server was very good.  Attentive, friendly, and a great conversationalist.  No issue at all.  I would have liked the servers to explain the dishes that we ordered, since this is a high end restaurant with unique dishes.  1/2 Star.\n\nFood - The word Fusion is in the name of the restaurant because Asian Fusion serves dishes inspired from many Southeast Asian Countries like Vietnam and Thailand.  I started with the Fried Calamari, which is served in a traditional Vietnamese style. The outside was light and crispy.  I loved it because it was the perfect example of taking a traditional dish and elevating it.  The Pho Rib is served with huge beef ribs and the pho broth is poured over in a tea kettle.  Again, this is not your mom's pho.  It was elevated and familiar at the same time.  The only letdown was the Pineapple Fried Rice.  It was just ok - order it for your IG feed, not your belly.  I have to give a bonus shout out to the To Go order.  We ordered a Pho Combo to go, and they expertly packaged it up.  Finally, Asian Fusion isn't cheap.  Don't except to eat the pho every day.  1  1/2 Stars.\n\nWill I Return? - Yes.  The atmosphere is great.  The service is great.  The food is familiar and unique at the same time.  There are many more dishes I want to try.  I'll be back. 1 Star.\n\nMy Yelp Rating Scale (Sum of all parts):\n1 Star - Atmosphere - Is it a cool dive?  Perhaps an upscale place?  No matter the type, atmosphere plays a big part and I'll give a star if I like it or thinks it has great charm.\n1 Star - Service - You can have a great meal with bad service.  But that's also what can make a five star joint drop to four.  It's important to the dining experience that service is great and on point.\n2 Stars - Food - I'll award up to two stars for the food, since this is the main reason we dine out.  Sometimes the extra star is given for value, but it's really all about the food.\n1 Star - Will I come back? - If I know for a fact I'll return, I'll give this a star. A place has to make an impression for me to return.\n\nEach Category can be given up to 1 star except food (2 stars) because I consider all these categories important to the overall dining experience.  I will sum them up to provide my final Yelp score.

I'm looking forward to trying the beef rib pho next time (though I might need to show a bit earlier since apparently they run out of it).\n\nMy friend had the crispy chicken pad Thai and I thought that dish was definitely a standout. I normally am not big on pad Thai but in all honesty, it didn't taste like pad Thai at all (which to me was a good thing). It was definitely a crispy version of something Thai-tasting but without the sour flavors of fish sauce and vinegar, so maybe more like a crispy pad woon sen or crispy pad thai? Either way, it was A+. [/INST] Food - Oxtail pho (cooked well with tender meat), Crispy chicken pad Thai (standout, not like traditional pad Thai, very delicious) </s>"}

We checked in through our reservations made on Yelp and we're seated immediately. If you were a walk-in, there was about an hour wait. The restaurant was fancy and very nice, we also had live music! What I loved about the live music was that it wasn't so loud to where my table couldn't hear each other, it was great!\n\nMy family ordered Mi Kho, Filet Mignon Pepper Steak, Combo Fried Rice, Thai Crispy Red Snapper (size L). From all of the food we ate, the Thai Crispy Red Snapper was the best; It was large, crispy, and the tamarind sauce was yummy! The Filet Mignon Pepper Steak came second, the steak was delicious. The conbo fried rice was okay, not the best but good. The Mi Kho unfortunately was not the greatest; The sauce was too strong and it just tasted like someone poured a lot of soy sauce and the pork belly was off, it tasted like tofu.\n\nOverall, I would come back to try more different items like their pho (which they're known for)! I would recommend the Red Snapper for sure :) [/INST] Food - Thai Crispy Red Snapper (best, large, crispy, yummy tamarind sauce), Filet Mignon Pepper Steak (delicious), Combo Fried Rice (good), Mi Kho (not the greatest, sauce too strong, port belly was off)||Ambiance - Fancy, live music, not too loud </s>"}

The rolls were tasty and crispy. Next, we tried the soup dumplings. Delicious. I like that they gave us a plate with sauces to dip in. Presentation was definitely on point with the next dishes. We tried the Tom yum fried rice, four seasons duck and pepper steak. Everything was full of flavor and I was worried about the duck being sweet with the lychee. It was not at all. It was very good. I am always afraid of trying Asian fusion places, but this place knows what they are doing. Presentation and flavor did not come short. They offer free garage parking.

It must have been at least a dozen of us, so they gave us a snazzy private room. We even had our own waitress, Jen, who somehow coordinated others to help her and we never wanted for anything.\n\nSo we went on a Wednesday on a reservation. Would probably suggest you making a reservation, especially given this restaurant's latest news of being on the Yelp 100. It is busy, busy!\n\nOn Wednesdays, they have some happy hour where you get major deals on wine. We did not partake, given the context of the dinner, but some did join in with a cocktail or two. I abstained. I'm admittedly not much of a drinker.\n\nWhile I cannot tell you what every single person ordered, I can tell you that a month later, we are still dreaming about their soup dumplings. While I may have had some before, they don't compare to the ones at this restaurant. They are perfectly seasoned and just like having little savory marshmallows in your mouth (if such a thing exists, after all).\n\nWe had some other appetizers, mainly a platter with variety including other dumplings, fried goodies, and I forget what else. For our entrees, pho was quite popular, as were the noodle and rice dishes. I, myself, had a salt and pepper shrimp rice dish that I thought wouldn't fill me and I was deceived. It looks small, but it will fill you. The spicy sauce, too, was delectable.\n\nFor dessert, we had the chocolate mousse and a flaming cheesecake. The presentation for that flaming cheesecake was beautiful, and I recommend this if you like a show and love pineapple. I love a show but hate pineapple, so I took a bite and called it a day. The chocolate mousse in comparison while good wasn't a stunner; most, if not all minus me, preferred the cheesecake. Ultimately, this was my favorite restaurant in Austin and I would love to return, especially for those soup dumplings. Yum, yum.

I was visiting from out of town and my cousin had recommended Qi Austin.  To be quite honest, it wasn't on my radar because I had come with an Austin foodie list of things to try but decided to proceed and  trust his judgement.\n\nMy party and I were served by Danny who was incredibly knowledgable and had the BEST recommendations for dinner. Drink knowledge was very impressive too. I had worked in the restaurant industry for over 10 years so I knew I was being helped by someone who was very good at their job. So we had full faith to have him decide pretty much our entire dinner. There were a couple of dishes we added to the list but the rest was taken care of by Danny. We enjoyed the food but we enjoyed the service even more. If we didn't have Danny as your server then we know we wouldn't have had the same memorable experience. Promote the man! He knows what he's doing! [/INST] Food - Enjoyed||Service - Exceptional, Great recommendations </s>"}

Located in the heart of the city, this restaurant promises a memorable dining experience.\n\nOur culinary journey began with an array of delectable appetizers. The Dim Sum Platter was a standout, featuring delicate dumplings filled with a variety of fillings, from succulent shrimp to flavorful pork. The pan-fried spring rolls were perfectly crispy, and the dipping sauces added a burst of flavor.\n\nFor the main course, we opted for a mix of dishes from different regions of China. The Peking Duck was a showstopper, with thin, crispy skin and tender meat. The traditional table-side carving added a touch of drama to the experience. The Sichuan Kung Pao Chicken packed a spicy punch with its fiery chili peppers, and the Mapo Tofu was a silky, spicy delight.\n\nThe Stir-Fried Shanghai Noodles showcased the chef's skill with wok cooking, and the flavors were spot-on. We also tried the fragrant Cantonese-style Steamed Fish, which was incredibly fresh and accompanied by a light ginger and soy sauce.\n\nThe restaurant boasts an extensive drink menu, including a variety of Chinese teas and a well-curated selection of wines and cocktails. We paired our meal with a fragrant jasmine tea that complemented the flavors perfectly.\n\nQi is a hidden treasure for those seeking an authentic Chinese dining experience. From the ambiance that transports you to China to the attentive service and the diverse, flavorful dishes, this restaurant is a must-visit for lovers of Chinese cuisine. The only reason for not awarding a full five stars is that, at times, the restaurant can be a bit crowded during peak hours. Nevertheless, it's a culinary journey worth embarking on.

And unlike so many restaurants that suffer after opening multiple locations, Qi is every bit as consistent, with that high dining service and atmosphere.\n\nShanghai dumplings are like none else, if Michelin were in Texas these would be top of their list. I branched out this time and was able to try the Lobster dumpling, more subtle, slightly sweet, still layers of complexity. I've never had a potsticker knock my socks off - this one WILL - Akaushi beef seasoned with a touch of scallion, gently steamed and reminiscent of tartare, with a crispy crown of lacy wrapper, soaking up just the right ratio of sauce. A treat! Ingredients in the fried rice were generous and fresh, but the dish was generally under seasoned, leaving room for intervention. Noodles were much better. Egg drop soup is rich but light, with the most delightful texture of egg to contrast with little fresh kernels of corn. I had the spicy shrimp in air-battered tempura with scallions & jalapeÃƒÂ±os. Very simple, straightforward, but lovely, balanced, sweet, peppery, spicy, a delight. Danny is a lovely host, helped guide us through the menu and towards a Sancerre that cut the fats just right.\n\nAside from sharing lunch with friends, knowing the dim sum brunch is an even better way to tour around the menu, I love that Qi is a similarly appropriate venue for a casual business lunch as it is a sentimental occasion, or (recommended) taking the large table to sample every entree on the menu paired with very fine wine & sake selections with all your friends.

We ordered the Peking Duck, Whole Red Snapper in soy ginger sauce, Truffle Egg Fried Rice, Combination Fried Rice, Braised Oxtail, Honey Akaushi Beef, Pork Belly (cooked 24 hours), Sesame Chicken, and Seasonal Vegetable with Bird Nest. I felt as if I was transported to NYC's Chinatown. Phenomenal food!\n\nThe 2 not-so-stellar dishes were the Honey Akaushi Beef and the Red Snapper. Some that had the beef had tender pieces, but I ended up with chewy ones. The fish was overcooked. Kris was an excellent server and the food came out quickly.\n\nWish that Chef Ling was in. Her family is from Fujian province, where my grandparents are from. Would have love to chat in Fujian dialect.

I just really loved their decor.\n\nService:\n\nWe went when it just opened, so it wasn't that bad. You could make a reservation ahead of time, but it wasn't necessary at the time we went. We were greeted by the host and then seated at a table when we entered. Our waitress was really lovely too. She was wonderful and helpful as well. She was a real delight. The way to order here is almost like a typical dim sum place. They give you a set menu and then you basically just mark down how many orders you want on the menu. Food came out pretty fast as soon as you place your order on the paper. So it wasn't that long of a wait to fill our bellies.\n\nFood:\n\nOh the food! What can I say about the food. Absolutely wonderful. We enjoyed every dish that we ordered. We also ordered the typical items that we usually order at dim sum. Luckily they had the items we always ordered. Their menu for dim sum was a bit restricted, but it still had a good amount of variety to it. We ordered harrow, xis mai, bbq buns, custard buns and a lobster filled dumpling I believe. We got that one because it was in the shape of a rabbit. Very cute! We left here with full and satisfied.\n\nWould we come again? Probably if we come back to Austin to visit.

First of all, the ambience is really nice. Note that you'll probably need a reservation ahead of time. But if you are a party of 1 or 2, there's almost always immediate seating at the bar or area in front of the kitchen.\n\nI haven't tried everything off their menu, but there are some major hits everyone should try:\n\nBasil Chicken Dumplings - For a dish that frankly sounds unassuming, these dumplings are a knockout. Must try if you want dumplings. The sauce that comes with it enhances it to another level.\n\nShrimp Har Gow - These are just done really well. The shrimp inside tastes fantastic and the texture of outer starchy skin is amazing. Probably the best Har Gow I've tried.\n\nHoney Akaushi Beef -  WOW. If there is anything that makes Qi deserving of the 5 star review, it is this dish here. I have never had anything like this. The beef is cooked so perfectly, with a nice outer crust. Once you bite into it, it is like an explosion of delicious beef flavor.  And the sauce is this well balanced mixing of honey and pepper that hits all the senses. My parents visited me in Austin and they were so impressed by this dish as well.\n\nMy only gripe with this restaurant is their pekin duck entree. Everything tasted great, but they only provided ~3-4 bao to make your duck \"tacos.\" And if you want more, you have to pay $1.50 for each extra bao! I'm not sure why they are nickle-and-diming so hard for this bread. Other Chinese restaurants give plenty.

I've dined here twice and my opinion hasn't changed much. I've tried a number of dim sum appetizers here and the Shanghai soup dumplings continue to be the best relative to the other options. Although, in comparison with other pork soup dumplings I've had at different establishments, this one falls to the bottom. The dough is too thick and vastly overpowers the under-seasoned filling. $13 for 5 pieces is also on the steep side. The peking duck was acceptable. It came with a pate you spread across the bao for flavor. There are only 3 baos that come with the order so expect disproportionate portions. I prefer my peking duck be wrapped thin pancakes or wraps, but unfortunately they don't offer that here. I much prefer the duck at Bamboo House or Jade at a much reasonable cost with more authentic flavors. The truffle fried rice was very underwhelming. Something that can easily be made at home. The only toppings it consisted of were egg and maybe 2 shavings of truffle. For a restaurant that encourages family style meals, the pork belly was really the only dish that was abundant. Unfortunately, it was doused in a sauce that didn't highlight the protein. The bird nest was probably the best thing that was ordered during this visit. The vegetables were seasoned nicely and the nest it was held in provided a satisfying crunch.\n\nFor dessert, we got the mango bomb and the fly me to the moon. I found the mango bomb a bit too tart the more bites I took, but fly me to the moon was finished off in a blink of an eye. Overall, if you're looking to spend a pretty penny, there are plenty of other options to choose from with beautiful ambiance and better bang for your buck. If you're looking for more authentic flavors, best to look elsewhere.

Street parking might not be the easiest but there's a parking garage for the building that Qi is located in. We were able to quickly get seating at the bar, which provides the best view of the steamers, woks, stock pots and chefs in action.\n\nCrab meat corn soup: substantial lumps of crab, warm, comforting soup. Great with some of the chili oil that you can ask for on the side\nAsian fried chicken: tender and juicy, seemed to be roasted rather than deep fried. Sauce of palm sugar and lime is addictive.\nPan sear basil chicken dumpling: never had Thai holy basil in a dumpling before, but it works. Thin wrapper and just lightly crispy.\nSzechuan peppercorn alligator: battered pieces of alligator with some toasted chilies, peppercorn, and scallion. Similar in texture to chicken and good flavor, but definitely more suitable for sharing family style.\nTruffle egg fried rice - in my opinion, a bit on the drier side though it's typical to use day-old rice. Yolk is mixed with each grain of rice to give a golden hue, and the yolk and earthy truffle flavor makes for a really fragrant bite. I think the truffle shaving on top could have been a bit thinner and maybe some scallions to garnish would have ben nice\nTingling daisy: probably the most unique cocktail I've had. You're supposed to take a nibble of the peppercorn flower in between sips for a little numbing sensation.\n\nOverall, definitely a spot worth trying out in Austin when you're looking to splurge a little.

Not only is the decor beautiful, but the food and service was good as well.\n\nThe interior of Qi's is nicely decorated with a mix of modern and traditional.\n\nThe service was phenomenal! The servers consistently checked up on us throughout the time and were very attentive, and after being seated, they pass out intricate designed plates and small bowls.\n\nI ordered the Shanghai soup dumplings, shrimp hargow, vegetable steamed dumplings, pan akaushi beef potstickers,  sesame chicken, and the salt and pepper tofu.\n\nDim Sum:\nThe Shanghai soup dumplings tasted delicious and creamy with just the right amount of soup and were my favorite.  The shrimp hargow was plump and had a huge shrimp. The pan akaushi came nicely decorated. The steamed vegetable dumplings were my least favorite. They tasted very strong of something earthy and bitter. I do not recommend getting them.\n\nOther Food:\nThe sesame chicken was good but tasted more generic. The salt and pepper tofu were pretty good, but I wish the outside were more crispy.\n\nOverall, the ambiance is nice, and the food is good with superb service.

We liked everything we got but our favorites were the shumai and the pork belly bc of how flavorful and juicy/tender they were!! They are known for their Shanghai soup dumplings but they were kinda eh to me just bc they tasted kinda frozen. We were so stuffed at the end and it was fun sharing everything family style.

On the pricier side, but one of the best dim sum places I've been to all year.. Fresh ingredients, a dash of fusion, piping hot when it comes out, with more that I haven't tried yet.\n\nCrab meat fish maw soup couplings - skin is on the thicker side, filling juicy and tender. Only complaint I have was that they didn't give me a soup spoon or extra bowls to eat this without spilling the juice.\n\nPork and shrimp sui mai - very fresh with good consistency.\n\nScallop caviar siu mai - amazingly good! 3 for $15 is a bit higher than the 5 for $12 normal siu mai, but flavor, texture (it was all mixed together, and not a normal siu mai with a scallop on top), juiciness exceeded my expectations. This siu mai was one of the best Ive had.\n\nScallion pancake curry dip - I like the concept and the strong onion flavor in the pancake, but I don't think the concept was executed very well. The pancake is on the smaller size and the curry is more liquid, so dipping it is very light, vs what you might get in a burmese paratha with coconut curry dip.\n\nCrispy chicken turnover - They look like little mice, with the outsides having a mochi consistency and insides being on the salty savory side. Really well done and highly recommended!\n\nShrimp stuffed chinese eggplant - This was more of a shrimp on top of an eggplant.. Shrimp was very tender with good flavor. I liked the overall consistency of the dish, but would recommend giving it a min to cool down before starting.\n\nEgg custard tart - very well executed with nice flavor, and extra flaky crust. It was more on the yellow side, and I personally would have preferred a little bit of a burn on the top.\n\nThe one dish I would not recommend is the stir fried potato glass noodle. For $19 its on the larger side, and its 100% carbs, so good value, but on the drier side and way too much to eat.

The space is well appointed and comfortable -- with staff that are zippy, friendly, and welcoming.\n\nThe Dim Sum selection is very good, encompassing a large variety that will satisfy those seeking more authentic items and preparations.  It does not pander to cliches of Western expectations of Chinese food, but highlights Chinese cuisine in a manner that is generally authentic but also approachable with a high regard for detail.  Dim Sum staples are all really well executed -- from Shrimp Har Gow, Pork Shu Mai, to Egg Tarts (too many to name).  The rock stars of various types of buns including the soup dumpling are well executed.  Many typically traditional items such as Pea Shoots for a vegetable entree or Chicken Feet dim sum were cool to see as options.\n\nA lot of what's on offer are interpretations that are up-leveled for concept, which they do very well.  The presentation of many items were very memorable, some admittedly were too aesthetically perfect to eat (specifically an item that was formed into the most adorable mice).  Finally, however, some items that are nice to see on the menu, deviate a bit too much from traditional expectations (specifically the Zar Zhang Noodles).\n\nOverall a standout for Dim Dum and Chinese cuisine in Austin.

Along with that, the crab meat corn soup is something we always order --and one bowl is definitely big enough of an appetizer to share between two people! Crispy whole fish and the truffle egg fried rice were two items that we ordered for the first time today, but both did not disappoint! The fish was lightly fried and covered in delicious sweet sauce, and was definitely big enough for 3+ people. The menu is at market price, and we paid $70, which I found to be pretty reasonable. Although both of us thought that the fish would go well with just a simple, white rice, the truffle egg fried rice was another great menu. It was super flavorful, and paired well with chili oil. They will definitely be a part of our staple items at Qi!

I could have made reservations prior but I didn't know if I would be craving dim sum at the time so decided to wing it.\n\nWell I was, and me and my girlfriend were not disappointed with the food.\n\nThe Shanghai sound dumplings arrived with better presentation than I would expect for soup dumplings. The broth was rich and complimented the soft ground pork inside the dumpling.\n\nI decided I was in AUSTIN TX and wanted to try something different, and got the alligator nuggets. It was like chicken but not tiring. Almost as if the fat was embedded into the fibers to keep it from becoming dry. My girlfriend didn't shut up about alligator tasting so good so that's how I knew the food had made the top of the list.\n\nThe truffle rice was amazing. I dont usually expect much from rice. It even Had a thinly sliced piece of truffle on top. My mouth watered. I didn't care for the noodles I ordered but what's a meal without noodles?  \n\nI'm glad we took a chance and came here despite almost being turned away from a fully booked restaurant. When we arrived they looked at us crazy for not having reservations. We sat at the countertops watching the cooks make the dumplings. After an hour and ten minutes of eating, the restaurant was still half empty. Maybe confirm your reservations before immediately offering us the counters.  \n\nThe inside was nice, hell I even took photos of the bathroom because the toilet seat would automatically open. Last time I saw these was at a Japanese Hyatt regency.

Did I forget to mention their bathroom has an automatic closing and opening lid? Lol I've digressed.\n\nI would 100% recommend their hargow (shrimp dumplings). The texture is right for the flour, and the shrimp is nice and crunchy! The sticky rice is also good, and I've never seen it in a braided banana leaf like that. It's a little impractical and over the top, but at least it was aesthetically pleasing! The Peking duck is decent and affordable, and would give it a try if you've never had crispy duck skin before.\n\nI would not recommend the xiaolongbao (soup dumplings). The dumpling was very mushy, and the filling was too sweet for my liking. I also did not like the egg bun. It was over cooked, and lacked the runny egg custard.

For a group of 3 at 7:30pm, we were sat immediately at a table outside under some fan/misting.\n\nFood was delicious:\n- the Shanghai soup dumplings were hot and unique in that the filling was soft and homogenous rather than a lump of meat sitting in a pool of liquid\n- Zha Jiang noodles were a touch spicy that made it flavorful and tasty\n- Honey Akaushi Beef was delicious with great soft texture and crunchy fresh onions in a sweet glaze\n- Baby Bok Choi was fresh and crunchy with yummy shiitake mushrooms and came beautifully presented\n\nThe ambiance was classy with thoughtful touches and nods to Asian culture around. The outdoor patio was on a relatively busy street, but didn't diminish the ambiance much.\n\nService was prompt and friendly, and food came out quickly!\n\nOur only gripe was the price tag. While the food was delicious, we weren't sure that the few pieces of beef garnered a $29 tag, nor the XLB/soup dumplings $3 each. Understandably, it's presenting itself as finer dining in an expensive-to-rent area, so we definitely think it's worth trying if you're willing to splurge!

If someone wanted to come eat here, I wouldn't deter them. It's just that Qi is not for me. Qi fills a specific niche (elevated Asian-inspired) which I don't often crave.\n\nOverall, the food here was fine but I probably wouldn't choose to come back since parking isn't \"easy\" and the meal wasn't really worth the price (to me). On the plus side, the ambiance was great, drink options were unique, and the menu offered some fun and diverse options. I'm glad to see them have success but it's just not for me. I'll stick to enjoying their dim sum items at Lin since the best part of their dinner menu was the XLB.

The restaurant is on the smaller side, however they also have outdoor seating too.  Nonetheless, it's the perfect place for date night, girls night out, dinner with family, etc.\n\nService - As soon as we entered the restaurant we were greeted and seated immediately which was great!  I didn't get the name of our waitress, but she was great to work with and super friendly. She made a few recommendations on the food, suggested a red blend wine which we loved and gave us complimentary dessert for our anniversary as well.

We ordered:\n\nCrab Meat Fish Soup Dumplings\nLobster Dumplings\nTruffle Egg Fried Rice\nShrimp Stuffed Eggplant\nShrimp Har Kaw\nPork & Shrimp Shu mai\nCilantro Shrimp Dumpling\nFried Snapper with Sweet & Sour sauce\n\nI also wanted to note their 3 dipping sauces for the dim sum, their chili sauce was my favorite!  It has a bit of sweetness to it which I loved!\n\nPricing - A bit on the higher end, but for the quality of the food, it's well worth paying.  \n\nParking - Free garage parking.

While it might not have been a mind-blowing revelation, there were certainly aspects of the meal that left a positive impression.\n\nQi's ambiance is comfortable and inviting. The restaurant's interior is tastefully decorated with subtle Chinese motifs, creating a relaxed and cozy atmosphere. It's an ideal spot for a casual dinner with friends or family.\n\nNow, onto the food. Qi offers a broad range of classic Chinese dishes, and the menu has something to suit various tastes. The highlights for me included the General Tso's Chicken, which had a nice balance of sweet and savory flavors, and the vegetable dumplings, which were delightfully fresh and accompanied by a tasty dipping sauce. The hot and sour soup was another winner, with a satisfying blend of tanginess and spiciness.

The dim sum is excellent, high quality and very nicely done. Some of the items are slightly fusion and adapted to this area and culture, but the quality and the workmanship put into the dim sum with spectacular presentation is well worth the extra cost. I'm from the San Francisco area and I am Asian so I know good dim sum.\n\nAll the ingredients are so fresh and they use locally sourced produce from a local farm when possible. We went there for dinner and it was so good and we were so impressed that we came back the next morning for dim sum! For dinner we had the bok choy with shiitake mushrooms, excellent with a subtle sauce on it. We also had the seafood curry which was chock-full of different types of seafood in it, they were very generous. Between dinner in the evening and dim sum the next morning, we had many of their dishes but I will just comment on some of the stand outs. For dim sum, their shrimp stuffed Chinese eggplant was so plump and delicious. Their crispy chicken turnovers were shaped like cute little mice, so fun to eat and delicious too! The salt and pepper shrimp was excellent, nice subtle flavors. Their cilantro shrimp dumplings and basil chicken dumplings were so satisfying and flavorful. We loved the Shanghai soup dumplings, round and plump with hearty broth inside. Their desserts are amazing and excellent, be sure to try one!\n\nThe service is immaculate, friendly and helpful and very efficient. The manager is a very good manager.  One thing fun about the place is that they have automatic toilets with motion sensors. The lid will automatically open when you come near it!

We started with the Shanghai soup dumplings, lobster dumplings and chicken taro egg rolls.\nThe special of the evening was a salt and pepper whole lobster, but we were disappointed to find out that at 7:30 in the evening, they were completely out! However, we were soon relieved when we were told that they still had the salt and pepper lobster tails available. We ordered those in addition to the honey beef and the truffle egg fried rice.

Located near Whole Foods downtown and not to far from Lin. They have their own garage so parking was easy.\n\nWe decided to try our luck again and did a walk-in. Would definitely recommend you make reservations though. After a small wait we were seated at the bar.  The place had beauty decorations everywhere from lanterns and umbrellas to robes and glass sculptures.  One thing that stood out to me was the signed bottle of wine near the front of the entrance. Pro Football Hall of Famer Tony Gonzalez!\n\nOur Baristas were Minh and \"Rabbit\". Not sure if they were just playing with us since it's the year of the Rabbit/Cat, but it was funny. They had a special Lunar new year drink menu. Tried both the Red Envelope and the Jade Rabbit. Both were beautiful and delicious and had gold flakes. We also tried a couple normal menu drinks Watermelon Cooler and Honey Cider. Both were very refreshing.\n\nFor appetizers we ordered the Crab Meat Corn Soup and Scallop Caviar Sui Mai Dumplings. The soup rich and the Crab delicious. The dumplings were delightful. They looked so good, I didn't give them a little time to cool before gobbling them up.\n\nBoth our entrees were beef protein. The Honey Akaushi Beef and Rainbow Akaushi Beef were cooked beautifully. They both had a nice crispy sear on the beef and flavorful sauce.\n\nAfter trying Lin, Qi did not disappoint. Fun servers and delicious food is always a great combination. Two thumbs up!

The best way to describe is exquisite dim sum and chinese cuisine. As a sister restaurant to Lin's, Qi has the famous soup dumplings that in my opinion make this place worth visiting.\n\nI have not yet encountered any other establishment that has great soup dumplings that are comparable to Qi/Lin's. Other items that I liked to get at the scallop caviar Sui mai, honey sesame chicken, and occasionally the har gow.\n\nIf you are used to normal traditional Chinese dim sum establishments, do NOT expect the same experience here. Expect to pay higher prices and receive good service. If you are looking for a large variety of dim sum items, I would look elsewhere in Austin. During lunch and dinner, the dim sum menu is not as expansive.\n\nI would say this makes for a great spot to meet with friends or go on a date. I'm hoping they will open a restaurant in Houston!

We get to our table and the waiter is on us immediately. We need a sec so he comes back again in about a minute. My wife orders a drink off their drinks menu, I order a captain & coke, daughter orders a Shirley temple. My wife's drink and the Shirley temple show up, we put in our order. No drink for me. 10 minutes later still no drink for me. So I get his attention and he comes over and before I can say where's my drink he says \"oh we don't have captain Morgan.\"... like 10 minutes went by and he didn't bother to tell me they couldn't make my drink...so I order a Bacardi and coke. This time it only took a few minutes for him to say they didn't have Bacardi.  At this point I'm annoyed so I make do with water for the night.\n\nThe food. Generally pretty good. The soup dumplings were just \"ok.\"  Not much there flavor wise. The beef dumplings were also just ok. But the shrimp dumplings (har gow?) were fantastic, as was the duck. Fried rice and sesame chicken were fine.\n\nSo, back to all the fun we had with the waiter. Now that's it's busier he's nowhere to be found. Woulda been great to have some of that food with some water...\n\nSo after dinner we mention that it's my daughters birthday. He brings out some ice cream and a candle which is great.\n\nWe get the bill, and to my disbelief he's charged for BOTH drinks that I didn't get, and also for the desert that we didn't order. Fortunately there was no argument about taking the drinks and desert off the bill.\n\nSo I guess the moral of this story is only order drinks off their drink menu, and check your bill.\n\nOh, they also forgot the baby bok choy we ordered (didn't even make its way into the bill).

Definitely go there for the vibes of the place more than anything. Our server was nice and handled our party of ten well. I would say the actual food is pretty mediocre and you're better off finding a local run restaurant that's more affordable instead. I got the spicy chicken and while it was good...there was nothing remarkable about it. It was my birthday and they brought out a little cat shaped passion fruit ice cream dessert so I did appreciate that.

We walked in on a busy weekend, grabbed a drink, and waited with fingers crossed that we would get a seat at the well appointed bar. Success! (I definitely recommend making resos.)\nWe tried all of the Lunar New Year special cocktails. They were beautifully crafted and served by witty and cheerful bartenders. The wine list is impressive!\nBut the true stars lie on the pages of the food menu.\nWe started with crab corn soup. It was somehow both light and hardy. The velvety broth was dotted with ample protein, yet the corn was perfectly highlighted.\nNext came the scallop caviar shu mai. What a treat. We could not resist the aroma and gobbled the steamy sea pillows. We could have stopped there, but the beef dishes called out. Both the pepper beef and honey beef were beautifully seasoned and seared. The honey beef was a bit overly honeyed for me. Also, I asked to make it spicy, but it was not. It was still delicious, but I preferred the pepper beef.\n\nAll in all, Qi is a must when looking for passionately chef-driven Asian cuisine in Austin. But once you eat at Lin, I just don't know if I can give another restaurant 5 stars! If I could give 4.9 though, I would!

I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed Qi so much more! It's beautiful inside, came here during December and the restaurant was very tastefully decorated festively.There is also free parking in the same building on level P4.\n\nWe tried a variety of things from the dim sum menu: Scallop Caviar Sui Mai, SautÃƒÂ©ed Baby Bok Choy, SautÃƒÂ©ed Water Spinach, Dan Dan Noodle, Scallion Pancake Curry Dip, Shrimp Har Kaw, Pork and Shrimp Sui Mai, Steam BBQ Pork Bun, Shanghai Soup Dumpling. I would pass on the SautÃƒÂ©ed Baby Bok Choy and Steam BBQ Pork Bun. My favorites were the SautÃƒÂ©ed Water Spinach, Shrimp Har Kaw, and Pork and Shrimp Sui Mai. The one thing we got from the main menu was the truffle fried rice. This was okay but nothing special, was way more impressed with the dim sum.

The menu is a creative fusion between American and pan-Asian--predominantly Chinese--dishes. If one were to rate this place based on its representation of more traditional dim sum, it would probably get only 2 stars.\n\nAlright! Now that we got that controversy out of the way, judging this establishment based purely on the quality of the food it serves, the experience, and the value, I'd give it 4 stars. Each of the dishes I've had here have generally been quite good, with nothing that stood out as anything altogether bad. If you have a xiao long bao craving, this place will work for you in a pinch. I feel guilty saying this, but one of my favorite dishes here in the past was the gator with Sichuan seasoning (see, I told you this was a fusion restaurant). This dish has a nice amount of numbing spice to it, and I can imagine that some people who aren't used to consuming numbing spice probably wouldn't be a fan (but I personally am). The cocktails here are also pretty solid and worth trying as well. [/INST] Food - gator with Sichuan seasoning (liked, numbing spice), dim sum (Asian-American fusion, not traditional)||Drinks - solid cocktails </s>"}
